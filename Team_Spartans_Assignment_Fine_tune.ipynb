Lord Houghton says of this stage --\\r\\n\"The pedestrians passed by Solway Frith through that delightful part of Kirkcudbrightshire, the scene of \\'Guy Mannering.\\' Keats had never read the novel, but was much struck with the character of Meg Merrilies as delineated to him by Brown. He seemed at once to realise the creation of the novelist, and, suddenly stopping in the pathway, at a point where a profusion of honeysuckles, wild rose, and fox-glove, mingled with the bramble and broom that filled up the spaces between the shattered rocks, he cried out, \\'Without a shadow of a doubt on that spot has old Meg Merrilies often boiled her kettle.\\'\"\\r\\nOn the 3rd of July he writes to Tom from \"Auchtercairn\" (meaning, I presume, Auchencairn, some six miles east of Kirkcudbright) -- \"We are now in Meg Merrilies\\' country, and have, this morning, passed through some parts exactly suited to her. Kirkcudbright County is very beautiful, very wild, with craggy hills, somewhat in the Westmoreland fashion.  We have come down from Dumfries to the sea-coast part of it. The following song you will have from Dilke, but perhaps you would like it here.\"\\r\\nI should judge that the scene given by Brown to Lord Houghton belonged rather to the morning of the 3rd than to the evening of the 2nd; and that Keats took out his current letter to his sister at Auchencairn on pausing there to breakfast, and wrote the poem into it when he began a fresh letter to Tom with it. Thus, besides a rough draft, there would be three fair copies of the poem, one for Tom, one for Fanny, and one for Mr. Dilke.\\'\\r\\n~ Poetical Works of John Keats, ed. H.

and the fauns from rushes green and brakes and cowslip lawns the ever smitten hermes empty left his golden throne bent warm on amorous theft from high olympus had he stolen light on this side of jove clouds to escape the sight of his great summoner and made retreat into forest on the shores of crete for somewhere in that sacred island dwelt nymph to whom all hoofed satyrs knelt at whose white feet the languid tritons poured pearls while on land they wither’d and adored fast by the springs where she to bathe was will not and in those meads where sometime she might haunt were strewn rich gifts unknown to any muse though fancy’s casket were unlock’d to choose ah what world of love was at her feet so hermes thought and celestial heat burnt from his winged heels to either ear that from whiteness as the lily clear blush’d into roses ’mid his golden hair fallen in jealous curls about his shoulders bare from vale to vale from wood to wood he flew breathing upon the flowers his passion new and wound with many river to its head to find where this sweet nymph prepar’d her secret bed in vain the sweet nymph might nowhere be found and so he rested on the lonely ground pensive and full of painful jealousies of the wood gods and even the very trees there as he stood he heard mournful voice such as once heard in gentle heart destroys all pain but pity thus the lone voice spake “when from this wreathed tomb shall awake “when move in sweet body fit for life “and love and pleasure and the ruddy strife “of hearts and lips ah miserable me the god dove footed glided silently round bush and tree soft brushing in his speed the taller grasses and full flowering weed until he found palpitating snake bright and cirque couchant in dusky brake she was gordian shape of dazzling hue vermilion spotted golden green and blue striped like zebra freckled like pard eyed like peacock and all crimson barr’d and full of silver moons that as she breathed dissolv’d or brighter shone or interwreathed their lustres with the gloomier tapestries— so rainbow sided touch’d with miseries she seem’d at once some penanced lady elf some demon’s mistress or the demon’s self upon her crest she wore wannish fire sprinkled with stars like ariadne’s tiar her head was serpent but ah bitter sweet she had woman’s mouth with all its pearls complete and for her eyes what could such eyes do there but weep and weep that they were born so fair as proserpine still weeps for her sicilian air her throat was serpent but the words she spake came as through bubbling honey for love’s sake and thus while hermes on his pinions lay like stoop’d falcon ere he takes his prey “fair hermes crown’d with feathers fluttering light “i had splendid dream of thee last night “i saw thee sitting on throne of gold “among the gods upon olympus old “the only sad one for thou didst not hear “the soft lute finger’d muses chaunting clear “nor even apollo when he sang alone “deaf to his throbbing throat’s long long melodious moan “i dreamt saw thee robed in purple flakes “break amorous through the clouds as morning breaks “and swiftly as bright phoebean dart “strike for the cretan isle and here thou art “too gentle hermes hast thou found the maid whereat the star of lethe not delay’d his rosy eloquence and thus inquired “thou smooth lipp’d serpent surely high inspired “thou beauteous wreath with melancholy eyes “possess whatever bliss thou canst devise “telling me only where my nymph is fled “where she doth breathe “bright planet thou hast said return’d the snake “but seal with oaths fair god “i swear said hermes “by my serpent rod “and by thine eyes and by thy starry crown light flew his earnest words among the blossoms blown then thus again the brilliance feminine “too frail of heart for this lost nymph of thine “free as the air invisibly she strays “about these thornless wilds her pleasant days “she tastes unseen unseen her nimble feet “leave traces in the grass and flowers sweet “from weary tendrils and bow’d branches green “she plucks the fruit unseen she bathes unseen “and by my power is her beauty veil’d “to keep it unaffronted unassail’d “by the love glances of unlovely eyes “of satyrs fauns and blear’d silenus’ sighs “pale grew her immortality for woe “of all these lovers and she grieved so “i took compassion on her bade her steep “her hair in weird syrops that would keep “her loveliness invisible yet free “to wander as she loves in liberty “thou shalt behold her hermes thou alone “if thou wilt as thou swearest grant my boon then once again the charmed god began an oath and through the serpent’s ears it ran warm tremulous devout psalterian ravish’d she lifted her circean head blush’d live damask and swift lisping said “i was woman let me have once more “a woman’s shape and charming as before “i love youth of corinth—o the bliss “give me my woman’s form and place me where he is “stoop hermes let me breathe upon thy brow “and thou shalt see thy sweet nymph even now the god on half shut feathers sank serene she breath’d upon his eyes and swift was seen of both the guarded nymph near smiling on the green it was no dream or say dream it was real are the dreams of gods and smoothly pass their pleasures in long immortal dream one warm flush’d moment hovering it might seem dash’d by the wood nymph’s beauty so he burn’d then lighting on the printless verdure turn’d to the swoon’d serpent and with languid arm delicate put to proof the lythe caducean charm so done upon the nymph his eyes he bent full of adoring tears and blandishment and towards her stept she like moon in wane faded before him cower’d nor could restrain her fearful sobs self folding like flower that faints into itself at evening hour but the god fostering her chilled hand she felt the warmth her eyelids open’d bland and like new flowers at morning song of bees bloom’d and gave up her honey to the lees into the green recessed woods they flew nor grew they pale as mortal lovers do left to herself the serpent now began to change her elfin blood in madness ran her mouth foam’d and the grass therewith besprent wither’d at dew so sweet and virulent her eyes in torture fix’d and anguish drear hot glaz’d and wide with lid lashes all sear flash’d phosphor and sharp sparks without one cooling tear the colours all inflam’d throughout her train she writh’d about convuls’d with scarlet pain deep volcanian yellow took the place of all her milder mooned body’s grace and as the lava ravishes the mead spoilt all her silver mail and golden brede made gloom of all her frecklings streaks and bars eclips’d her crescents and lick’d up her stars so that in moments few she was undrest of all her sapphires greens and amethyst and rubious argent of all these bereft nothing but pain and ugliness were left still shone her crown that vanish’d also she melted and disappear’d as suddenly and in the air her new voice luting soft cried “lycius gentle lycius ”—borne aloft with the bright mists about the mountains hoar these words dissolv’d crete’s forests heard no more whither fled lamia now lady bright full born beauty new and exquisite she fled into that valley they pass over who go to corinth from cenchreas’ shore and rested at the foot of those wild hills the rugged founts of the peraean rills and of that other ridge whose barren back stretches with all its mist and cloudy rack south westward to cleone there she stood about young bird’s flutter from wood fair on sloping green of mossy tread by clear pool wherein she passioned to see herself escap’d from so sore ills while her robes flaunted with the daffodils ah happy lycius —for she was maid more beautiful than ever twisted braid or sigh’d or blush’d or on spring flowered lea spread green kirtle to the minstrelsy virgin purest lipp’d yet in the lore of love deep learned to the red heart’s core not one hour old yet of sciential brain to unperplex bliss from its neighbour pain define their pettish limits and estrange their points of contact and swift counterchange intrigue with the specious chaos and dispart its most ambiguous atoms with sure art as though in cupid’s college she had spent sweet days lovely graduate still unshent and kept his rosy terms in idle languishment why this fair creature chose so fairily by the wayside to linger we shall see but first it is fit to tell how she could muse and dream when in the serpent prison house of all she list strange or magnificent how ever where she will’d her spirit went whether to faint elysium or where down through tress lifting waves the nereids fair wind into thetis’ bower by many pearly stair or where god bacchus drains his cups divine stretch’d out at ease beneath glutinous pine or where in pluto’s gardens palatine mulciber’s columns gleam in far piazzian line and sometimes into cities she would send her dream with feast and rioting to blend and once while among mortals dreaming thus she saw the young corinthian lycius charioting foremost in the envious race like young jove with calm uneager face and fell into swooning love of him now on the moth time of that evening dim he would return that way as well she knew to corinth from the shore for freshly blew the eastern soft wind and his galley now grated the quaystones with her brazen prow in port cenchreas from egina isle fresh anchor’d whither he had been awhile to sacrifice to jove whose temple there waits with high marble doors for blood and incense rare jove heard his vows and better’d his desire for by some freakful chance he made retire from his companions and set forth to walk perhaps grown wearied of their corinth talk over the solitary hills he fared thoughtless at first but ere eve’s star appeared his phantasy was lost where reason fades in the calm’d twilight of platonic shades lamia beheld him coming near more near— close to her passing in indifference drear his silent sandals swept the mossy green so neighbour’d to him and yet so unseen she stood he pass’d shut up in mysteries his mind wrapp’d like his mantle while her eyes follow’d his steps and her neck regal white turn’d—syllabling thus “ah lycius bright “and will you leave me on the hills alone “lycius look back and be some pity shown he did not with cold wonder fearingly but orpheus like at an eurydice for so delicious were the words she sung it seem’d he had lov’d them whole summer long and soon his eyes had drunk her beauty up leaving no drop in the bewildering cup and still the cup was full —while he afraid lest she should vanish ere his lip had paid due adoration thus began to adore her soft look growing coy she saw his chain so sure “leave thee alone look back ah goddess see “whether my eyes can ever turn from thee “for pity do not this sad heart belie— “even as thou vanishest so shall die “stay though naiad of the rivers stay “to thy far wishes will thy streams obey “stay though the greenest woods be thy domain “alone they can drink up the morning rain “though descended pleiad will not one “of thine harmonious sisters keep in tune “thy spheres and as thy silver proxy shine “so sweetly to these ravish’d ears of mine “came thy sweet greeting that if thou shouldst fade “thy memory will waste me to shade “for pity do not melt ”—“if should stay said lamia “here upon this floor of clay “and pain my steps upon these flowers too rough “what canst thou say or do of charm enough “to dull the nice remembrance of my home “thou canst not ask me with thee here to roam “over these hills and vales where no joy is “empty of immortality and bliss “thou art scholar lycius and must know “that finer spirits cannot breathe below “in human climes and live alas poor youth “what taste of purer air hast thou to soothe “my essence what serener palaces “where may all my many senses please “and by mysterious sleights hundred thirsts appease “it cannot be—adieu so said she rose tiptoe with white arms spread he sick to lose the amorous promise of her lone complain swoon’d murmuring of love and pale with pain the cruel lady without any show of sorrow for her tender favourite’s woe but rather if her eyes could brighter be with brighter eyes and slow amenity put her new lips to his and gave afresh the life she had so tangled in her mesh and as he from one trance was wakening into another she began to sing happy in beauty life and love and every thing song of love too sweet for earthly lyres while like held breath the stars drew in their panting fires and then she whisper’d in such trembling tone as those who safe together met alone for the first time through many anguish’d days use other speech than looks bidding him raise his drooping head and clear his soul of doubt for that she was woman and without any more subtle fluid in her veins than throbbing blood and that the self same pains inhabited her frail strung heart as his and next she wonder’d how his eyes could miss her face so long in corinth where she said she dwelt but half retir’d and there had led days happy as the gold coin could invent without the aid of love yet in content till she saw him as once she pass’d him by where ’gainst column he leant thoughtfully at venus’ temple porch ’mid baskets heap’d of amorous herbs and flowers newly reap’d late on that eve as it was the night before the adonian feast whereof she saw no more but wept alone those days for why should she adore lycius from death awoke into amaze to see her still and singing so sweet lays then from amaze into delight he fell to hear her whisper woman’s lore so well and every word she spake entic’d him on to unperplex’d delight and pleasure known let the mad poets say whate’er they please of the sweets of fairies peris goddesses there is not such treat among them all haunters of cavern lake and waterfall as real woman lineal indeed from pyrrha’s pebbles or old adam’s seed thus gentle lamia judg’d and judg’d aright that lycius could not love in half fright so threw the goddess off and won his heart more pleasantly by playing woman’s part with no more awe than what her beauty gave that while it smote still guaranteed to save lycius to all made eloquent reply marrying to every word twinborn sigh and last pointing to corinth ask’d her sweet if it was too far that night for her soft feet the way was short for lamia’s eagerness made by spell the triple league decrease to few paces not at all surmised by blinded lycius so in her comprized they pass’d the city gates he knew not how so noiseless and he never thought to know as men talk in dream so corinth all throughout

the corniced shade of some arch’d temple door or dusky colonnade muffling his face of greeting friends in fear her fingers he press’d hard as one came near with curl’d gray beard sharp eyes and smooth bald crown slow stepp’d and robed in philosophic gown lycius shrank closer as they met and past into his mantle adding wings to haste while hurried lamia trembled “ah said he “why do you shudder love so ruefully “why does your tender palm dissolve in dew ”— “i am wearied said fair lamia “tell me who “is that old man cannot bring to mind “his features —lycius wherefore did you blind “yourself from

the Fauns\\xa0  \\nFrom rushes green, and brakes, and cowslip\\'d lawns, \\nThe ever-smitten Hermes empty left \\nHis golden throne, bent warm on amorous theft: \\nFrom high Olympus had he stolen light, \\nOn this side of Jove\\'s clouds, to escape the sight\\xa0 \\nOf his great summoner, and made retreat \\nInto a forest on the shores of Crete. \\nFor somewhere in that sacred island dwelt \\nA nymph, to whom all hoofed Satyrs knelt; \\nAt whose white feet the languid Tritons poured\\xa0 \\nPearls, while on land they wither’d and adored. \\nFast by the springs where she to bathe was wont, \\nAnd in those meads where sometime she might haunt, \\nWere strewn rich gifts, unknown to any Muse, \\nThough Fancy’s casket were unlock’d to choose.\\xa0 \\nAh, what a world of love was at her feet! \\nSo Hermes thought, and a celestial heat \\nBurnt from his winged heels to either ear, \\nThat from a whiteness, as the lily clear, \\nBlush’d into roses ’mid his golden hair,\\xa0 \\nFallen in jealous curls about his shoulders bare. \\nFrom vale to vale, from wood to wood, he flew, \\nBreathing upon the flowers his passion new, \\nAnd wound with many a river to its head, \\nTo find where this sweet nymph prepar’d her secret bed:\\xa0 \\nIn vain; the sweet nymph might nowhere be found, \\nAnd so he rested, on the lonely ground, \\nPensive, and full of painful jealousies \\nOf the Wood-Gods, and even the very trees. \\nThere as he stood, he heard a mournful voice,\\xa0 \\nSuch as once heard, in gentle heart, destroys \\nAll pain but pity: thus the lone voice spake: \\n“When from this wreathed tomb shall I awake! \\n“When move in a sweet body fit for life, \\n“And love, and pleasure, and the ruddy strife\\xa0 \\n“Of hearts and lips! Ah, miserable me!” \\nThe God, dove-footed, glided silently \\nRound bush and tree, soft-brushing, in his speed, \\nThe taller grasses and full-flowering weed, \\nUntil he found a palpitating snake,\\xa0 \\nBright, and cirque-couchant in a dusky brake. \\n\\xa0 \\n\\xa0 She was a gordian shape of dazzling hue, \\nVermilion-spotted, golden, green, and blue; \\nStriped like a zebra, freckled like a pard, \\nEyed like a peacock, and all crimson barr’d;\\xa0 \\nAnd full of silver moons, that, as she breathed, \\nDissolv’d, or brighter shone, or interwreathed \\nTheir lustres with the gloomier tapestries— \\nSo rainbow-sided, touch’d with miseries, \\nShe seem’d, at once, some penanced lady elf,\\xa0 \\nSome demon’s mistress, or the demon’s self. \\nUpon her crest she wore a wannish fire \\nSprinkled with stars, like Ariadne’s tiar: \\nHer head was serpent, but ah, bitter-sweet! \\nShe had a woman’s mouth with all its pearls complete:\\xa0 \\nAnd for her eyes: what could such eyes do there \\nBut weep, and weep, that they were born so fair? \\nAs Proserpine still weeps for her Sicilian air. \\nHer throat was serpent, but the words she spake \\nCame, as through bubbling honey, for Love’s sake,\\xa0 \\nAnd thus; while Hermes on his pinions lay, \\nLike a stoop’d falcon ere he takes his prey. \\n\\xa0 \\n\\xa0 “Fair Hermes, crown’d with feathers, fluttering light, \\n“I had a splendid dream of thee last night: \\n“I saw thee sitting, on a throne of gold,\\xa0 \\n“Among the Gods, upon Olympus old, \\n“The only sad one; for thou didst not hear \\n“The soft, lute-finger’d Muses chaunting clear, \\n“Nor even Apollo when he sang alone, \\n“Deaf to his throbbing throat’s long, long melodious moan.\\xa0 \\n“I dreamt I saw thee, robed in purple flakes, \\n“Break amorous through the clouds, as morning breaks, \\n“And, swiftly as a bright Phoebean dart, \\n“Strike for the Cretan isle; and here thou art! \\n“Too gentle Hermes, hast thou found the maid?”\\xa0 \\nWhereat the star of Lethe not delay’d \\nHis rosy eloquence, and thus inquired: \\n“Thou smooth-lipp’d serpent, surely high inspired! \\n“Thou beauteous wreath, with melancholy eyes, \\n“Possess whatever bliss thou canst devise,\\xa0 \\n“Telling me only where my nymph is fled,— \\n“Where she doth breathe!” “Bright planet, thou hast said,” \\nReturn’d the snake, “but seal with oaths, fair God!” \\n“I swear,” said Hermes, “by my serpent rod, \\n“And by thine eyes, and by thy starry crown!”\\xa0 \\nLight flew his earnest words, among the blossoms blown. \\nThen thus again the brilliance feminine: \\n“Too frail of heart! for this lost nymph of thine, \\n“Free as the air, invisibly, she strays \\n“About these thornless wilds; her pleasant days\\xa0 \\n“She tastes unseen; unseen her nimble feet \\n“Leave traces in the grass and flowers sweet; \\n“From weary tendrils, and bow’d branches green, \\n“She plucks the fruit unseen, she bathes unseen: \\n“And by my power is her beauty veil’d \\n“To keep it unaffronted, unassail’d \\n“By the love-glances of unlovely eyes, \\n“Of Satyrs, Fauns, and blear’d Silenus’ sighs. \\n“Pale grew her immortality, for woe \\n“Of all these lovers, and she grieved so \\n“I took compassion on her, bade her steep \\n“Her hair in weird syrops, that would keep \\n“Her loveliness invisible, yet free \\n“To wander as she loves, in liberty. \\n“Thou shalt behold her, Hermes, thou alone, \\n“If thou wilt, as thou swearest, grant my boon!” \\nThen, once again, the charmed God began \\nAn oath, and through the serpent’s ears it ran \\nWarm, tremulous, devout, psalterian. \\nRavish’d, she lifted her Circean head, \\nBlush’d a live damask, and swift-lisping said, \\n“I was a woman, let me have once more \\n“A woman’s shape, and charming as before. \\n“I love a youth of Corinth—O the bliss! \\n“Give me my woman’s form, and place me where he is. \\n“Stoop, Hermes, let me breathe upon thy brow, \\n“And thou shalt see thy sweet nymph even now.” \\nThe God on half-shut feathers sank serene, \\nShe breath’d upon his eyes, and swift was seen \\nOf both the guarded nymph near-smiling on the green. \\nIt was no dream; or say a dream it was, \\nReal are the dreams of Gods, and smoothly pass \\nTheir pleasures in a long immortal dream. \\nOne warm, flush’d moment, hovering, it might seem \\nDash’d by the wood-nymph’s beauty, so he burn’d; \\nThen, lighting on the printless verdure, turn’d \\nTo the swoon’d serpent, and with languid arm, \\nDelicate, put to proof the lythe Caducean charm. \\nSo done, upon the nymph his eyes he bent, \\nFull of adoring tears and blandishment, \\nAnd towards her stept: she, like a moon in wane, \\nFaded before him, cower’d, nor could restrain \\nHer fearful sobs, self-folding like a flower \\nThat faints into itself at evening hour: \\nBut the God fostering her chilled hand, \\nShe felt the warmth, her eyelids open’d bland, \\nAnd, like new flowers at morning song of bees, \\nBloom’d, and gave up her honey to the lees. \\nInto the green-recessed woods they flew; \\nNor grew they pale, as mortal lovers do. \\n\\xa0 \\n\\xa0 Left to herself, the serpent now began \\nTo change; her elfin blood in madness ran, \\nHer mouth foam’d, and the grass, therewith besprent, \\nWither’d at dew so sweet and virulent; \\nHer eyes in torture fix’d, and anguish drear, \\nHot, glaz’d, and wide, with lid-lashes all sear, \\nFlash’d phosphor and sharp sparks, without one cooling tear. \\nThe colours all inflam’d throughout her train, \\nShe writh’d about, convuls’d with scarlet pain: \\nA deep volcanian yellow took the place \\nOf all her milder-mooned body’s grace; \\nAnd, as the lava ravishes the mead, \\nSpoilt all her silver mail, and golden brede; \\nMade gloom of all her frecklings, streaks and bars, \\nEclips’d her crescents, and lick’d up her stars: \\nSo that, in moments few, she was undrest \\nOf all her sapphires, greens, and amethyst, \\nAnd rubious-argent: of all these bereft, \\nNothing but pain and ugliness were left. \\nStill shone her crown; that vanish’d, also she \\nMelted and disappear’d as suddenly; \\nAnd in the air, her new voice luting soft, \\nCried, “Lycius! gentle Lycius!”—Borne aloft \\nWith the bright mists about the mountains hoar \\nThese words dissolv’d: Crete’s forests heard no more. \\n\\xa0 \\n\\xa0 Whither fled Lamia, now a lady bright, \\nA full-born beauty new and exquisite? \\nShe fled into that valley they pass o’er \\nWho go to Corinth from Cenchreas’ shore; \\nAnd rested at the foot of those wild hills, \\nThe rugged founts of the Peraean rills, \\nAnd of that other ridge whose barren back \\nStretches, with all its mist and cloudy rack, \\nSouth-westward to Cleone. There she stood \\nAbout a young bird’s flutter from a wood, \\nFair, on a sloping green of mossy tread, \\nBy a clear pool, wherein she passioned \\nTo see herself escap’d from so sore ills, \\nWhile her robes flaunted with the daffodils. \\n\\xa0 \\n\\xa0 Ah, happy Lycius!—for she was a maid \\nMore beautiful than ever twisted braid, \\nOr sigh’d, or blush’d, or on spring-flowered lea \\nSpread a green kirtle to the minstrelsy: \\nA virgin purest lipp’d, yet in the lore \\nOf love deep learned to the red heart’s core: \\nNot one hour old, yet of sciential brain \\nTo unperplex bliss from its neighbour pain; \\nDefine their pettish limits, and estrange \\nTheir points of contact, and swift counterchange; \\nIntrigue with the specious chaos, and dispart \\nIts most ambiguous atoms with sure art; \\nAs though in Cupid’s college she had spent \\nSweet days a lovely graduate, still unshent, \\nAnd kept his rosy terms in idle languishment. \\n\\xa0 \\n\\xa0 Why this fair creature chose so fairily \\nBy the wayside to linger, we shall see; \\nBut first ’tis fit to tell how she could muse \\nAnd dream, when in the serpent prison-house, \\nOf all she list, strange or magnificent: \\nHow, ever, where she will’d, her spirit went; \\nWhether to faint Elysium, or where \\nDown through tress-lifting waves the Nereids fair \\nWind into Thetis’ bower by many a pearly stair; \\nOr where God Bacchus drains his cups divine, \\nStretch’d out, at ease, beneath a glutinous pine; \\nOr where in Pluto’s gardens palatine \\nMulciber’s columns gleam in far piazzian line. \\nAnd sometimes into cities she would send \\nHer dream, with feast and rioting to blend; \\nAnd once, while among mortals dreaming thus, \\nShe saw the young Corinthian Lycius \\nCharioting foremost in the envious race, \\nLike a young Jove with calm uneager face, \\nAnd fell into a swooning love of him. \\nNow on the moth-time of that evening dim \\nHe would return that way, as well she knew, \\nTo Corinth from the shore; for freshly blew \\nThe eastern soft wind, and his galley now \\nGrated the quaystones with her brazen prow \\nIn port Cenchreas, from Egina isle \\nFresh anchor’d; whither he had been awhile \\nTo sacrifice to Jove, whose temple there \\nWaits with high marble doors for blood and incense rare. \\nJove heard his vows, and better’d his desire; \\nFor by some freakful chance he made retire \\nFrom his companions, and set forth to walk, \\nPerhaps grown wearied of their Corinth talk: \\nOver the solitary hills he fared, \\nThoughtless at first, but ere eve’s star appeared \\nHis phantasy was lost, where reason fades, \\nIn the calm’d twilight of Platonic shades. \\nLamia beheld him coming, near, more near— \\nClose to her passing, in indifference drear, \\nHis silent sandals swept the mossy green; \\nSo neighbour’d to him, and yet so unseen \\nShe stood: he pass’d, shut up in mysteries, \\nHis mind wrapp’d like his mantle, while her eyes \\nFollow’d his steps, and her neck regal white \\nTurn’d—syllabling thus, “Ah, Lycius bright, \\n“And will you leave me on the hills alone? \\n“Lycius, look back! and be some pity shown.” \\nHe did; not with cold wonder fearingly, \\nBut Orpheus-like at an Eurydice; \\nFor so delicious were the words she sung, \\nIt seem’d he had lov’d them a whole summer long: \\nAnd soon his eyes had drunk her beauty up, \\nLeaving no drop in the bewildering cup, \\nAnd still the cup was full,—while he afraid \\nLest she should vanish ere his lip had paid \\nDue adoration, thus began to adore; \\nHer soft look growing coy, she saw his chain so sure: \\n“Leave thee alone! Look back! Ah, Goddess, see \\n“Whether my eyes can ever turn from thee! \\n“For pity do not this sad heart belie— \\n“Even as thou vanishest so I shall die. \\n“Stay! though a Naiad of the rivers, stay! \\n“To thy far wishes will thy streams obey: \\n“Stay! though the greenest woods be thy domain, \\n“Alone they can drink up the morning rain: \\n“Though a descended Pleiad, will not one \\n“Of thine harmonious sisters keep in tune \\n“Thy spheres, and as thy silver proxy shine? \\n“So sweetly to these ravish’d ears of mine \\n“Came thy sweet greeting, that if thou shouldst fade \\n“Thy memory will waste me to a shade:— \\n“For pity do not melt!”—“If I should stay,” \\nSaid Lamia, “here, upon this floor of clay, \\n“And pain my steps upon these flowers too rough, \\n“What canst thou say or do of charm enough \\n“To dull the nice remembrance of my home? \\n“Thou canst not ask me with thee here to roam \\n“Over these hills and vales, where no joy is,— \\n“Empty of immortality and bliss! \\n“Thou art a scholar, Lycius, and must know \\n“That finer spirits cannot breathe below \\n“In human climes, and live: Alas! poor youth, \\n“What taste of purer air hast thou to soothe \\n“My essence? What serener palaces, \\n“Where I may all my many senses please, \\n“And by mysterious sleights a hundred thirsts appease? \\n“It cannot be—Adieu!” So said, she rose \\nTiptoe with white arms spread. He, sick to lose \\nThe amorous promise of her lone complain, \\nSwoon’d, murmuring of love, and pale with pain. \\nThe cruel lady, without any show \\nOf sorrow for her tender favourite’s woe, \\nBut rather, if her eyes could brighter be, \\nWith brighter eyes and slow amenity, \\nPut her new lips to his, and gave afresh \\nThe life she had so tangled in her mesh: \\nAnd as he from one trance was wakening \\nInto another, she began to sing, \\nHappy in beauty, life, and love, and every thing, \\nA song of love, too sweet for earthly lyres, \\nWhile, like held breath, the stars drew in their panting fires \\nAnd then she whisper’d in such trembling tone, \\nAs those who, safe together met alone \\nFor the first time through many anguish’d days, \\nUse other speech than looks; bidding him raise \\nHis drooping head, and clear his soul of doubt, \\nFor that she was a woman, and without \\nAny more subtle fluid in her veins \\nThan throbbing blood, and that the self-same pains \\nInhabited her frail-strung heart as his. \\nAnd next she wonder’d how his eyes could miss \\nHer face so long in Corinth, where, she said, \\nShe dwelt but half retir’d, and there had led \\nDays happy as the gold coin could invent \\nWithout the aid of love; yet in content \\nTill she saw him, as once she pass’d him by, \\nWhere ’gainst a column he leant thoughtfully \\nAt Venus’ temple porch, ’mid baskets heap’d \\nOf amorous herbs and flowers, newly reap’d \\nLate on that eve, as ’twas the night before \\nThe Adonian feast; whereof she saw no more, \\nBut wept alone those days, for why should she adore? \\nLycius from death awoke into amaze, \\nTo see her still, and singing so sweet lays; \\nThen from amaze into delight he fell \\nTo hear her whisper woman’s lore so well; \\nAnd every word she spake entic’d him on \\nTo unperplex’d delight and pleasure known. \\nLet the mad poets say whate’er they please \\nOf the sweets of Fairies, Peris, Goddesses, \\nThere is not such a treat among them all, \\nHaunters of cavern, lake, and waterfall, \\nAs a real woman, lineal indeed \\nFrom Pyrrha’s pebbles or old Adam’s seed. \\nThus gentle Lamia judg’d, and judg’d aright, \\nThat Lycius could not love in half a fright, \\nSo threw the goddess off, and won his heart \\nMore pleasantly by playing woman’s part, \\nWith no more awe than what her beauty gave, \\nThat, while it smote, still guaranteed to save. \\nLycius to all made eloquent reply, \\nMarrying to every word a twinborn sigh; \\nAnd last, pointing to Corinth, ask’d her sweet, \\nIf ’twas too far that night for her soft feet. \\nThe way was short, for Lamia’s eagerness \\nMade, by a spell, the triple league decrease \\nTo a few paces; not at all surmised \\nBy blinded Lycius, so in her comprized. \\nThey pass’d the city gates, he knew not how \\nSo noiseless, and he never thought to know. \\n\\xa0 \\n\\xa0 As men talk in a dream, so Corinth all, \\nThroughout her palaces imperial, \\nAnd all her populous streets and temples lewd, \\nMutter’d, like tempest in the distance brew’d, \\nTo the wide-spreaded night above her towers. \\nMen, women, rich and poor, in the cool hours, \\nShuffled their sandals o’er the pavement white, \\nCompanion’d or alone; while many a light \\nFlared, here and there, from wealthy festivals, \\nAnd threw their moving shadows on the walls, \\nOr found them cluster’d in the corniced shade \\nOf some arch’d temple door, or dusky colonnade. \\n\\xa0 \\n\\xa0 Muffling his face, of greeting friends in fear, \\nHer fingers he press’d hard, as one came near \\nWith curl’d gray beard, sharp eyes, and smooth bald crown, \\nSlow-stepp’d, and robed in philosophic gown: \\nLycius shrank closer, as they met and past, \\nInto his mantle, adding wings to haste, \\nWhile hurried Lamia trembled: “Ah,” said he, \\n“Why do you shudder, love, so ruefully? \\n“Why does your tender palm dissolve in dew?”— \\n“I’m wearied,” said fair Lamia: “tell me who \\n“Is that old man? I cannot bring to mind \\n“His features:—Lycius! wherefore did you blind \\n“Yourself from his quick eyes?” Lycius replied, \\n“’Tis Apollonius sage, my trusty guide \\n“And good instructor; but to-night he seems \\n“The ghost of folly haunting my sweet dreams. \\n\\xa0 \\n\\xa0 While yet he spake they had arrived before \\nA pillar\\'d porch, with lofty portal door, \\nWhere hung a silver lamp, whose phosphor glow \\nReflected in the slabbed steps below, \\nMild as a star in water; for so new, \\nAnd so unsullied was the marble hue, \\nSo through the crystal polish, liquid fine, \\nRan the dark veins, that none but feet divine \\nCould e\\'er have touch\\'d there. Sounds Aeolian \\nBreath\\'d from the hinges, as the ample span \\nOf the wide doors disclos\\'d a place unknown \\nSome time to any, but those two alone, \\nAnd a few Persian mutes, who that same year \\nWere seen about the markets: none knew where \\nThey could inhabit; the most curious \\nWere foil\\'d, who watch\\'d to trace them to their house: \\nAnd but the flitter-winged verse must tell, \\nFor truth\\'s sake, what woe afterwards befel, \\n\\'Twould humour many a heart to leave them thus, \\nShut from the busy world of more incredulous.(line 48): Originally, \"Cerulean-spotted.\" Leigh Hunt says of this passage, \"The admiration, pity, and horror, to be excited by humanity in a brute shape, were never perhaps called upon by a greater mixture of beauty and deformity than in the picture of this creature. Our pity and suspicions are begged by the first word: the profuse and vital beauties with which she is covered seem proportioned to her misery and natural rights; and lest we should lose sight of them in this gorgeousness, the \\'woman\\'s mouth\\' fills us at once with shuddering and compassion.\"\\n\\n(line 158): The manuscript reads \"vulcanian,\" the first edition \"volcanian.\" It seems to me more likely that the manuscript accords with the poet\\'s intention than that printed text does, for this old orthography is the more characteristic of the vocabulary of this particular poem, as introducing the more conspicuously the mythic personal origin of the common noun \"volcano\" or \"vulcano.\"\\n\\n~ Poetical Works of John Keats, ed.

It was then that he composed that sonnet of solemn tenderness, \\'Bright star! would I were stedfast as thou art,\\' &c.and wrote it out in a copy of Shakespeare\\'s Poems he had given to Severn a few days before.  I know nothing written afterwards.\"The copy of Shakespeare\\'s Poetical Works had been given to Keats by John Hamilton Reynolds, and is now in the possession of Sir Charles Dilke [rather was in 125 years ago]. It is a royal 8vo volume \"printed for Thomas Wilson, No. 10, London-House-yard, St. Paul\\'s,\" in 1806; and this sonnet, of which a fac-simile is here given, is written upon the verso of the fly-title to A Lover\\'s Complaint.  It seems fair to assume that the reason of its being so high up on the page is that it thus faces a space of equal size containing no words except a boldly printed heading of Shakespeare\\'s poem, A Lover\\'s Complaint, as if in that mournful moment Keats desired to appropriate to his last poetic utterance a style and title already immortal.  Lord Houghton gives a variant of the last line -- \\'Half-passionless, and so swoon on to death.\\'As there is no trace of this in the Shakespeare, there must have been another manuscript -- perhaps a pencilled draft -- and it is to be presumed that the words \\'fall and swell\\', in line 11 of Lord Houghton\\'s text occurred in that, \\'swell and fall\\', the reading of the Shakespeare, being in that case an error of transcription on Keats\\'s part.

the moon the passion poesy glories infinite haunt us till they become cheering light unto our souls and bound to us so fast that whether there be shine or gloom ercast they alway must be with us or we die therefore it is with full happiness that will trace the story of endymion the very music of the name has gone into my being and each pleasant scene is growing fresh before me as the green of our own vallies so will begin now while cannot hear the city din now while the early budders are just new and run in mazes of the youngest hue about old forests while the willow trails its delicate amber and the dairy pails bring home increase of milk and as the year grows lush in juicy stalks will smoothly steer my little boat for many quiet hours with streams that deepen freshly into bowers many and many verse hope to write before the daisies vermeil rimm and white hide in deep herbage and ere yet the bees hum about globes of clover and sweet peas must be near the middle of my story may no wintry season bare and hoary see it half finished but let autumn bold with universal tinge of sober gold be all about me when make an end and now at once adventuresome send my herald thought into wilderness there let its trumpet blow and quickly dress my uncertain path with green that may speed easily onward thorough flowers and weed upon the sides of latmos was outspread mighty forest for the moist earth fed so plenteously all weed hidden roots into over hanging boughs and precious fruits and it had gloomy shades sequestered deep where no man went and if from shepherd keep lamb strayed far down those inmost glens never again saw he the happy pens whither his brethren bleating with content over the hills at every nightfall went among the shepherds it was believed ever that not one fleecy lamb which thus did sever from the white flock but pass unworried by angry wolf or pard with prying head until it came to some unfooted plains where fed the herds of pan ay great his gains who thus one lamb did lose paths there were many winding through palmy fern and rushes fenny and ivy banks all leading pleasantly to wide lawn whence one could only see stems thronging all around between the swell of turf and slanting branches who could tell the freshness of the space of heaven above edg round with dark tree tops through which dove would often beat its wings and often too little cloud would move across the blue full in the middle of this pleasantness there stood marble altar with tress of flowers budded newly and the dew had taken fairy phantasies to strew daisies upon the sacred sward last eve and so the dawned light in pomp receive for it was the morn apollo upward fire made every eastern cloud silvery pyre of brightness so unsullied that therein melancholy spirit well might win oblivion and melt out his essence fine into the winds rain scented eglantine gave temperate sweets to that well wooing sun the lark was lost in him cold springs had run to warm their chilliest bubbles in the grass man voice was on the mountains and the mass of nature lives and wonders puls tenfold to feel this sun rise and its glories old now while the silent workings of the dawn were busiest into that self same lawn all suddenly with joyful cries there sped troop of little children garlanded who gathering round the altar seemed to pry earnestly round as wishing to espy some folk of holiday nor had they waited for many moments ere their ears were sated with faint breath of music which ev then fill out its voice and died away again within little space again it gave its airy swellings with gentle wave to light hung leaves in smoothest echoes breaking through copse clad vallies —ere their death over taking the surgy murmurs of the lonely sea and now as deep into the wood as we might mark lynx eye there glimmered light fair faces and rush of garments white plainer and plainer shewing till at last into the widest alley they all past making directly for the woodland altar kindly muse let not my weak tongue faulter in telling of this goodly company of their old piety and of their glee but let portion of ethereal dew fall on my head and presently unmew my soul that may dare in wayfaring to stammer where old chaucer used to sing leading the way young damsels danced along bearing the burden of shepherd song each having white wicker over brimm with april tender younglings next well trimm crowd of shepherds with as sunburnt looks as may be read of in arcadian books such as sat listening round apollo pipe when the great deity for earth too ripe let his divinity over flowing die in music through the vales of thessaly some idly trailed their sheep hooks on the ground and some kept up shrilly mellow sound with ebon tipped flutes close after these now coming from beneath the forest trees venerable priest full soberly begirt with ministring looks alway his eye stedfast upon the matted turf he kept and after him his sacred vestments swept from his right hand there swung vase milk white of mingled wine out sparkling generous light and in his left he held basket full of all sweet herbs that searching eye could cull wild thyme and valley lilies whiter still than leda love and cresses from the rill his aged head crowned with beechen wreath seem like poll of ivy in the teeth of winter hoar then came another crowd of shepherds lifting in due time aloud their share of the ditty after them appear up followed by multitude that rear their voices to the clouds fair wrought car easily rolling so as scarce to mar the freedom of three steeds of dapple brown who stood therein did seem of great renown among the throng his youth was fully blown shewing like ganymede to manhood grown and for those simple times his garments were chieftain king beneath his breast half bare was hung silver bugle and between his nervy knees there lay boar spear keen smile was on his countenance he seem to common lookers on like one who dream of idleness in groves elysian but there were some who feelingly could scan lurking trouble in his nether lip and see that oftentimes the reins would slip through his forgotten hands then would they sigh and think of yellow leaves of owlets cry of logs piled solemnly —ah well day why should our young endymion pine away soon the assembly in circle rang stood silent round the shrine each look was chang to sudden veneration women meek beckon their sons to silence while each cheek of virgin bloom paled gently for slight fear endymion too without forest peer stood wan and pale and with an awed face among his brothers of the mountain chase in midst of all the venerable priest eyed them with joy from greatest to the least and after lifting up his aged hands thus spake he men of latmos shepherd bands whose care it is to guard thousand flocks whether descended from beneath the rocks that overtop your mountains whether come from vallies where the pipe is never dumb or from your swelling downs where sweet air stirs blue hare bells lightly and where prickly furze buds lavish gold or ye whose precious charge nibble their fill at ocean very marge whose mellow reeds are touch with sounds forlorn by the dim echoes of old triton horn mothers and wives who day by day prepare the scrip with needments for the mountain air and all ye gentle girls who foster up udderless lambs and in little cup will put choice honey for favoured youth yea every one attend for in good truth our vows are wanting to our great god pan are not our lowing heifers sleeker than night swollen mushrooms are not our wide plains speckled with countless fleeces have not rains green over april lap no howling sad sickens our fearful ewes and we have had great bounty from endymion our lord the earth is glad the merry lark has pour his early song against yon breezy sky that spreads so clear over our solemnity thus ending on the shrine he heap spire of teeming sweets enkindling sacred fire anon he stain the thick and spongy sod with wine in honour of the shepherd god now while the earth was drinking it and while bay leaves were crackling in the fragrant pile and gummy frankincense was sparkling bright neath smothering parsley and hazy light spread greyly eastward thus chorus sang thou whose mighty palace roof doth hang from jagged trunks and overshadoweth eternal whispers glooms the birth life death of unseen flowers in heavy peacefulness who lov st to see the hamadryads dress their ruffled locks where meeting hazels darken and through whole solemn hours dost sit and hearken the dreary melody of bedded reeds— in desolate places where dank moisture breeds the pipy hemlock to strange overgrowth bethinking thee how melancholy loth thou wast to lose fair syrinx—do thou now by thy love milky brow by all the trembling mazes that she ran hear us great pan thou for whose soul soothing quiet turtles passion their voices cooingly mong myrtles what time thou wanderest at eventide through sunny meadows that outskirt the side of thine enmossed realms thou to whom broad leaved fig trees even now foredoom their ripen fruitage yellow girted bees their golden honeycombs our village leas their fairest blossom beans and poppied corn the chuckling linnet its five young unborn to sing for thee low creeping strawberries their summer coolness pent up butterflies their freckled wings yea the fresh budding year all its completions—be quickly near by every wind that nods the mountain pine forester divine thou to whom every fawn and satyr flies for willing service whether to surprise the squatted hare while in half sleeping fit or upward ragged precipices flit to save poor lambkins from the eagle maw or by mysterious enticement draw bewildered shepherds to their path again or to tread breathless round the frothy main and gather up all fancifullest shells for thee to tumble into naiads cells and being hidden laugh at their out peeping or to delight thee with fantastic leaping the while they pelt each other on the crown with silvery oak apples and fir cones brown— by all the echoes that about thee ring hear us satyr king hearkener to the loud clapping shears while ever and anon to his shorn peers ram goes bleating winder of the horn when snouted wild boars routing tender corn anger our huntsman breather round our farms to keep off mildews and all weather harms strange ministrant of undescribed sounds that come swooning over hollow grounds and wither drearily on barren moors dread opener of the mysterious doors leading to universal knowledge—see great son of dryope the many that are come to pay their vows with leaves about their brows be still the unimaginable lodge for solitary thinkings such as dodge conception to the very bourne of heaven then leave the naked brain be still the leaven that spreading in this dull and clodded earth gives it touch ethereal—a new birth be still symbol of immensity firmament reflected in sea an element filling the space between an unknown—but no more we humbly screen with uplift hands our foreheads lowly bending and giving out shout most heaven rending conjure thee to receive our humble paean upon thy mount lycean even while they brought the burden to close shout from the whole multitude arose that lingered in the air like dying rolls of abrupt thunder when ionian shoals of dolphins bob their noses through the brine meantime on shady levels mossy fine young companies nimbly began dancing to the swift treble pipe and humming string aye those fair living forms swam heavenly to tunes forgotten—out of memory fair creatures whose young children children bred thermopylæ its heroes—not yet dead but in old marbles ever beautiful high genitors unconscious did they cull time sweet first fruits—they danc to weariness and then in quiet circles did they press the hillock turf and caught the latter end of some strange history potent to send young mind from its bodily tenement or they might watch the quoit pitchers intent on either side pitying the sad death of hyacinthus when the cruel breath of zephyr slew him —zephyr penitent who now ere phoebus mounts the firmament fondles the flower amid the sobbing rain the archers too upon wider plain beside the feathery whizzing of the shaft and the dull twanging bowstring and the raft branch down sweeping from tall ash top call up thousand thoughts to envelope those who would watch perhaps the trembling knee and frantic gape of lonely niobe poor lonely niobe when her lovely young were dead and gone and her caressing tongue lay lost thing upon her paly lip and very very deadliness did nip her motherly cheeks arous from this sad mood by one who at distance loud halloo uplifting his strong bow into the air many might after brighter visions stare after the argonauts in blind amaze tossing about on neptune restless ways until from the horizon vaulted side there shot golden splendour far and wide spangling those million poutings of the brine with quivering ore it was even an awful shine from the exaltation of apollo bow heavenly beacon in their dreary woe who thus were ripe for high contemplating might turn their steps towards the sober ring where sat endymion and the aged priest mong shepherds gone in eld whose looks increas the silvery setting of their mortal star there they discours upon the fragile bar that keeps us from our homes ethereal and what our duties there to nightly call vesper the beauty crest of summer weather to summon all the downiest clouds together for the sun purple couch to emulate in ministring the potent rule of fate with speed of fire tailed exhalations to tint her pallid cheek with bloom who cons sweet poesy by moonlight besides these world of other unguess offices anon they wander by divine converse into elysium vieing to rehearse each one his own anticipated bliss one felt heart certain that he could not miss his quick gone love among fair blossom boughs where every zephyr sigh pouts and endows her lips with music for the welcoming another wish mid that eternal spring to meet his rosy child with feathery sails sweeping eye earnestly through almond vales who suddenly should stoop through the smooth wind and with the balmiest leaves his temples bind and ever after through those regions be his messenger his little mercury some were athirst in soul to see again their fellow huntsmen over the wide champaign in times long past to sit with them and talk of all the chances in their earthly walk comparing joyfully their plenteous stores of happiness to when upon the moors benighted close they huddled from the cold and shar their famish scrips thus all out told their fond imaginations —saving him whose eyelids curtain up their jewels dim endymion yet hourly had he striven to hide the cankering venom that had riven his fainting recollections now indeed his senses had swoon off he did not heed the sudden silence or the whispers low or the old eyes dissolving at his woe or anxious calls or close of trembling palms or maiden sigh that grief itself embalms but in the self same fixed trance he kept like one who on the earth had never stept aye even as dead still as marble man frozen in that old tale arabian who whispers him so pantingly and close peona his sweet sister of all those his friends the dearest hushing signs she made and breath sister sorrow to persuade yielding up cradling on her care her eloquence did breathe away the curse she led him like some midnight spirit nurse of happy changes in emphatic dreams along path between two little streams guarding his forehead with her round elbow from low grown branches and his footsteps slow from stumbling over stumps and hillocks small until they came to where these streamlets fall with mingled bubblings and gentle rush into river clear brimful and flush with crystal mocking of the trees and sky little shallop floating there hard by pointed its beak over the fringed bank and soon it lightly dipt and rose and sank and dipt again with the young couple weight peona guiding through the water straight towards bowery island opposite which gaining presently she steered light into shady fresh and ripply cove where nested was an arbour overwove by many summer silent fingering to whose cool bosom she was used to bring her playmates with their needle broidery and minstrel memories of times gone by so she was gently glad to see him laid under her favourite bower quiet shade on her own couch new made of flower leaves dried carefully on the cooler side of sheaves when last the sun his autumn tresses shook and the tann harvesters rich armfuls took soon was he quieted to slumbrous rest but ere it crept upon him he had prest peona busy hand against his lips and still sleeping held her finger tips in tender pressure and as willow keeps patient watch over the stream that creeps windingly by it so the quiet maid held her in peace so that whispering blade of grass wailful gnat bee bustling down in the blue bells or wren light rustling among seer leaves and twigs might all be heard magic sleep comfortable bird that broodest over the troubled sea of the mind till it is hush and smooth unconfin restraint imprisoned liberty great key to golden palaces strange minstrelsy fountains grotesque new trees bespangled caves echoing grottos full of tumbling waves and moonlight aye to all the mazy world of silvery enchantment —who upfurl beneath thy drowsy wing triple hour but renovates and lives —thus in the bower endymion was calm to life again opening his eyelids with healthier brain he said feel this thine endearing love all through my bosom thou art as dove trembling its closed eyes and sleeked wings about me and the pearliest dew not brings such morning incense from the fields of may as do those brighter drops that twinkling stray from those kind eyes —the very home and haunt of sisterly affection can want aught else aught nearer heaven than such tears yet dry them up in bidding hence all fears that any longer will pass my days alone and sad no will once more raise my voice upon the mountain heights once more make my horn parley from their foreheads hoar again my trooping hounds their tongues shall loll around the breathed boar again will poll the fair grown yew tree for chosen bow and when the pleasant sun is getting low again will linger in sloping mead to hear the speckled thrushes and see feed our idle sheep so be thou cheered sweet and if thy lute is here softly intreat my soul to keep in its resolved course hereat peona in their silver source shut her pure sorrow drops with glad exclaim and took lute from which there pulsing came lively prelude fashioning the way in which her voice should wander it was lay more subtle cadenced more forest wild than dryope lone lulling of her child and nothing since has floated in the air so mournful strange surely some influence rare went spiritual through the damsel hand for still with delphic emphasis she spann the quick invisible strings even though she saw endymion spirit melt away and thaw before the deep intoxication but soon she came with sudden burst upon her self possession—swung the lute aside and earnestly said brother it is vain to hide that thou dost know of things mysterious immortal starry such alone could thus weigh down thy nature hast thou sinn in aught offensive to the heavenly powers caught paphian dove upon message sent thy deathful bow against some deer herd bent sacred to dian haply thou hast seen her naked limbs among the alders green and that alas is death no can trace something more high perplexing in thy face endymion look at her and press her hand and said art thou so pale who wast so bland and merry in our meadows how is this tell me thine ailment tell me all amiss ah thou hast been unhappy at the change wrought suddenly in me what indeed more strange or more complete to overwhelm surmise ambition is no sluggard it is no prize that toiling years would put within my grasp that have sigh for with so deadly gasp no man ever panted for mortal love so all have set my heavier grief above these things which happen rightly have they done who still saw the horizontal sun heave his broad shoulder over the edge of the world out facing lucifer and then had hurl my spear aloft as signal for the chace— who for very sport of heart would race with my own steed from araby pluck down vulture from his towery perching frown lion into growling loth retire— to lose at once all my toil breeding fire and sink thus low but will ease my breast of secret grief here in this bowery nest this river does not see the naked sky till it begins to progress silverly around the western border of the wood whence from certain spot its winding flood seems at the distance like crescent moon and in that nook the very pride of june had been used to pass my weary eves the rather for the sun unwilling leaves so dear picture of his sovereign power and could witness his most kingly hour when he doth lighten up the golden reins and paces leisurely down amber plains his snorting four now when his chariot last its beams against the zodiac lion cast there blossom suddenly magic bed of sacred ditamy and poppies red at which wondered greatly knowing well that but one night had wrought this flowery spell and sitting down close by began to muse what it might mean perhaps thought morpheus in passing here his owlet pinions shook or it may be ere matron night uptook her ebon urn young mercury by stealth had dipt his rod in it such garland wealth came not by common growth thus on thought until my head was dizzy and distraught moreover through the dancing poppies stole breeze most softly lulling to my soul and shaping visions all about my sight of colours wings and bursts of spangly light the which became more strange and strange and dim and then were gulph in tumultuous swim and then fell asleep ah can tell the enchantment that afterwards befel yet it was but dream yet such dream that never tongue although it overteem with mellow utterance like cavern spring could figure out and to conception bring all beheld and felt methought lay watching the zenith where the milky way among the stars in virgin splendour pours and travelling my eye until the doors of heaven appear to open for my flight became loth and fearful to alight from such high soaring by downward glance so kept me stedfast in that airy trance spreading imaginary pinions wide when presently the stars began to glide and faint away before my eager view at which sigh that could not pursue and dropt my vision to the horizon verge and lo from opening clouds saw emerge the loveliest moon that ever silver over she will for neptune goblet she did soar so passionately bright my dazzled soul commingling with her argent spheres did roll through clear and cloudy even when she went at last into dark and vapoury tent— whereat methought the lidless eyed train of planets all were in the blue again to commune with those orbs once more rais my sight right upward but it was quite dazed by bright something sailing down apace making me quickly veil my eyes and face again look and ye deities who from olympus watch our destinies whence that completed form of all completeness whence came that high perfection of all sweetness speak stubborn earth and tell me where where hast thou symbol of her golden hair not oat sheaves drooping in the western sun not—thy soft hand fair sister let me shun such follying before thee—yet she had indeed locks bright enough to make me mad and they were simply gordian up and braided leaving in naked comeliness unshaded her pearl round ears white neck and orbed brow the which were blended in know not how with such paradise of lips and eyes blush tinted cheeks half smiles and faintest sighs that when think thereon my spirit clings and plays about its fancy till the stings of human neighbourhood envenom all unto what awful power shall call to what high fane —ah see her hovering feet more bluely vein more soft more whitely sweet than those of sea born venus when she rose from out her cradle she will the wind out blows her scarf into fluttering pavilion it is blue and over spangled with million of little eyes as though thou wert to she would over the darkest lushest blue bell bed handfuls of daisies endymion how strange dream within dream she took an airy range and then towards me like very maid came blushing waning willing and afraid and press me by the hand ah it was too much methought fainted at the charmed touch yet held my recollection even as one who dives three fathoms where the waters run gurgling in beds of coral for anon felt upmounted in that region where falling stars dart their artillery forth and eagles struggle with the buffeting north that balances the heavy meteor stone felt too was not fearful nor alone but lapp and lull along the dangerous sky soon as it seem we left our journeying high and straightway into frightful eddies swoop such as ay muster where grey time has scoop huge dens and caverns in mountain side there hollow sounds arous me and sigh to faint once more by looking on my bliss— was distracted madly did kiss the wooing arms which held me and did give my eyes at once to death but it was to live to take in draughts of life from the gold fount of kind and passionate looks to count and count the moments by some greedy help that seem second self that each might be redeem and plunder of its load of blessedness ah desperate mortal ev dar to press her very cheek against my crowned lip and at that moment felt my body dip into warmer air moment more our feet were soft in flowers there was store of newest joys upon that alp sometimes scent of violets and blossoming limes loiter around us then of honey cells made delicate from all white flower bells and once above the edges of our nest an arch face peep —an oread as guess why did dream that sleep over power me in midst of all this heaven why not see far off the shadows of his pinions dark and stare them from me but no like spark that needs must die although its little beam reflects upon diamond my sweet dream fell into nothing—into stupid sleep and so it was until gentle creep careful moving caught my waking ears and up started ah my sighs my tears my clenched hands —for lo the poppies hung dew dabbled on their stalks the ouzel sung heavy ditty and the sullen day had chidden herald hesperus away with leaden looks the solitary breeze bluster and slept and its wild self did teaze with wayward melancholy and thought mark me peona that sometimes it brought faint fare thee wells and sigh shrilled adieus away wander d—all the pleasant hues of heaven and earth had faded deepest shades were deepest dungeons heaths and sunny glades were full of pestilent light our taintless rills seem sooty and over spread with upturn gills of dying fish the vermeil rose had blown in frightful scarlet and its thorns out grown like spiked aloe if an innocent bird before my heedless footsteps stirr and stirr in little journeys beheld in it disguis demon missioned to knit my soul with under darkness to entice my stumblings down some monstrous precipice therefore eager followed and did curse the disappointment time that aged nurse rock me to patience now thank gentle heaven these things with all their comfortings are given to my down sunken hours and with thee sweet sister help to stem the ebbing sea of weary life thus ended he and both sat silent for the maid was very loth to answer feeling well that breathed words would all be lost unheard and vain as swords against the enchased crocodile or leaps of grasshoppers against the sun she weeps and wonders struggles to devise some blame to put on such look as would say shame on this poor weakness but for all her strife she could as soon have crush away the life from sick dove at length to break the pause she said with trembling chance is this the because this all yet it is strange and sad alas that one who through this middle earth should pass most like sojourning demi god and leave his name upon the harp string should achieve no higher bard than simple maidenhood singing alone and fearfully —how the blood left his young cheek and how he used to stray he knew not where and how he would say nay if any said it was love and yet it was love what could it be but love how ring dove let fall sprig of yew tree in his path and how he died and then that love doth scathe the gentle heart as northern blasts do roses and then the ballad of his sad life closes with sighs and an alas —endymion be rather in the trumpet mouth —anon among the winds at large—that all may hearken although before the crystal heavens darken watch and dote upon the silver lakes pictur in western cloudiness that takes the semblance of gold rocks and bright gold sands islands and creeks and amber fretted strands with horses prancing over them palaces and towers of amethyst —would so tease my pleasant days because could not mount into those regions the morphean fount of that fine element that visions dreams and fitful whims of sleep are made of streams into its airy channels with so subtle so thin breathing not the spider shuttle circled million times within the space of swallow nest door could delay trace tinting of its quality how light must dreams themselves be seeing they are more slight than the mere nothing that engenders them then wherefore sully the entrusted gem of high and noble life with thoughts so sick why pierce high fronted honour to the quick for nothing but dream hereat the youth look up conflicting of shame and ruth was in his plaited brow yet his eyelids widened little as when zephyr bids little breeze to creep between the fans of careless butterflies amid his pains he seem to taste drop of manna dew full palatable and colour grew upon his cheek while thus he lifeful spake peona ever have long to slake my thirst for the world praises nothing base no merely slumberous phantasm could unlace the stubborn canvas for my voyage prepar d— though now it is tatter leaving my bark bar and sullenly drifting yet my higher hope is of too wide too rainbow large scope to fret at myriads of earthly wrecks wherein lies happiness in that which becks our ready minds to fellowship divine fellowship with essence till we shine full alchemiz and free of space behold the clear religion of heaven fold rose leaf round thy finger taperness and soothe thy lips hist when the airy stress of music kiss impregnates the free winds and with sympathetic touch unbinds eolian magic from their lucid wombs then old songs waken from enclouded tombs old ditties sigh above their father grave ghosts of melodious prophecyings rave round every spot where trod apollo foot bronze clarions awake and faintly bruit where long ago giant battle was and from the turf lullaby doth pass in every place where infant orpheus slept feel we these things —that moment have we stept into sort of oneness and our state is like floating spirit but there are richer entanglements enthralments far more self destroying leading by degrees to the chief intensity the crown of these is made of love and friendship and sits high upon the forehead of humanity all its more ponderous and bulky worth is friendship whence there ever issues forth steady splendour but at the tip top there hangs by unseen film an orbed drop of light and that is love its influence thrown in our eyes genders novel sense at which we start and fret till in the end melting into its radiance we blend mingle and so become part of it nor with aught else can our souls interknit so wingedly when we combine therewith life self is nourish by its proper pith and we are nurtured like pelican brood aye so delicious is the unsating food that men who might have tower in the van of all the congregated world to fan and winnow from the coming step of time all chaff of custom wipe away all slime left by men slugs and human serpentry have been content to let occasion die whilst they did sleep in love elysium and truly would rather be struck dumb than speak against this ardent listlessness for have ever thought that it might bless the world with benefits unknowingly as does the nightingale upperched high and cloister among cool and bunched leaves— she sings but to her love nor ever conceives how tiptoe night holds back her dark grey hood just so may love although it is understood the mere commingling of passionate breath produce more than our searching witnesseth what know not but who of men can tell that flowers would bloom or that green fruit would swell to melting pulp that fish would have bright mail the earth its dower of river wood and vale the meadows runnels runnels pebble stones the seed its harvest or the lute its tones tones ravishment or ravishment its sweet if human souls did never kiss and greet now if this earthly love has power to make men being mortal immortal to shake ambition from their memories and brim their measure of content what merest whim seems all this poor endeavour after fame to one who keeps within his stedfast aim love immortal an immortal too look not so wilder for these things are true and never can be born of atomies that buzz about our slumbers like brain flies leaving us fancy sick no no am sure my restless spirit never could endure to brood so long upon one luxury unless it did though fearfully espy hope beyond the shadow of dream my sayings will the less obscured seem when have told thee how my waking sight has made me scruple whether that same night was pass in dreaming hearken sweet peona beyond the matron temple of latona which we should see but for these darkening boughs lies deep hollow from whose ragged brows bushes and trees do lean all round athwart and meet so nearly that with wings outraught and spreaded tail vulture could not glide past them but he must brush on every side some moulder steps lead into this cool cell far as the slabbed margin of well whose patient level peeps its crystal eye right upward through the bushes to the sky oft have brought thee flowers on their stalks set like vestal primroses but dark velvet edges them round and they have golden pits it was there got them from the gaps and slits in mossy stone that sometimes was my seat when all above was faint with mid day heat and there in strife no burning thoughts to heed would bubble up the water through reed so reaching back to boy hood make me ships of moulted feathers touchwood alder chips with leaves stuck in them and the neptune be of their petty ocean oftener heavily when love lorn hours had left me less child sat contemplating the figures wild of over head clouds melting the mirror through upon day while thus watch by flew cloudy cupid with his bow and quiver so plainly character no breeze would shiver the happy chance so happy was fain to follow it upon the open plain and therefore was just going when behold wonder fair as any have told— the same bright face tasted in my sleep smiling in the clear well my heart did leap through the cool depth —it moved as if to flee— started up when lo refreshfully there came upon my face in plenteous showers dew drops and dewy buds and leaves and flowers wrapping all objects from my smothered sight bathing my spirit in new delight aye such breathless honey feel of bliss alone preserved me from the drear abyss of death for the fair form had gone again pleasure is oft visitant but pain clings cruelly to us like the gnawing sloth on the deer tender haunches late and loth it is scar away by slow returning pleasure how sickening how dark the dreadful leisure of weary days made deeper exquisite by fore knowledge of unslumbrous night like sorrow came upon me heavier still than when wander from the poppy hill and whole age of lingering moments crept sluggishly by ere more contentment swept away at once the deadly yellow spleen yes thrice have this fair enchantment seen once more been tortured with renewed life when last the wintry gusts gave over strife with the conquering sun of spring and left the skies warm and serene but yet with moistened eyes in pity of the shatter infant buds that time thou didst adorn with amber studs my hunting cap because laugh and smil chatted with thee and many days exil all torment from my breast —it was even then straying about yet coop up in the den of helpless discontent —hurling my lance from place to place and following at chance at last by hap through some young trees it struck and plashing among bedded pebbles stuck in the middle of brook —whose silver ramble down twenty little falls through reeds and bramble tracing along it brought me to cave whence it ran brightly forth and white did lave the nether sides of mossy stones and rock mong which it gurgled blythe adieus to mock its own sweet grief at parting overhead hung lush screen of drooping weeds and spread thick as to curtain up some wood nymph home ah impious mortal whither do roam said low voic ah whither it is the grot of proserpine when hell obscure and hot doth her resign and where her tender hands she dabbles on the cool and sluicy sands or it is the cell of echo where she sits and babbles thorough silence till her wits are gone in tender madness and anon faints into sleep with many dying tone of sadness that she would take my vows and breathe them sighingly among the boughs to sue her gentle ears for whose fair head daily pluck sweet flowerets from their bed and weave them dyingly—send honey whispers round every leaf that all those gentle lispers may sigh my love unto her pitying charitable echo hear and sing this ditty to her —tell her —so stay my foolish tongue and listening half afraid stood stupefied with my own empty folly and blushing for the freaks of melancholy salt tears were coming when heard my name most fondly lipp and then these accents came ‘endymion the cave is secreter than the isle of delos echo hence shall stir no sighs but sigh warm kisses or light noise of thy combing hand the while it travelling cloys and trembles through my labyrinthine hair at that oppress hurried in —ah where are those swift moments whither are they fled will smile no more peona nor will wed sorrow the way to death but patiently bear up against it so farewel sad sigh and come instead demurest meditation to occupy me wholly and to fashion my pilgrimage for the world dusky brink no more will count over link by link my chain of grief no longer strive to find half forgetfulness in mountain wind blustering about my ears aye thou shalt see dearest of sisters what my life shall be what calm round of hours shall make my days there is paly flame of hope that plays where er look but yet will say it is naught— and

admetus when banished from olympus for killing the cyclops who had forged the thunder bolts wherewith aesculapius had been slain line 232 it was the hymn to pan beginning here that the young poet when engaged in the composition of endymion was induced to recite in the presence of wordsworth on the 28th of december 1817 at haydon house leigh hunt records that the elder poet pronounced it very pretty piece of paganism line 319 doubtless meant to refer specially to the elgin marbles line 347 the reference here is to the passage from the second book of the argonautica of apollonius rhodius beginning at verse 674 which shelley had in mind when prose works vol 56 he alluded to the apollo so finely described by apollonius rhodius when the dazzling radiance of his beautiful limbs suddenly shone over the dark euxine note found before the preface of endymion in the poetical works of john keats ed buxton forman crowell publ 1895 in woodhouse copy of endymion there is note against the passage so will begin line 39 book to the effect that the poem was begun in the spring of 1817 and finished in the winter of 1817 18 and in the title page he has inserted april before 1818 the statement corresponds with keats own record of may 1817 that he was busying himself at margate with the commencement of endymion preface knowing within myself the manner in which this poem has been produced it is not without feeling of regret that make it public what manner mean will be quite clear to the reader who must soon perceive great inexperience immaturity and every error denoting feverish attempt rather than deed accomplished the two first books and indeed the two last feel sensible are not of such completion as to warrant their passing the press nor should they if thought year castigation would do them any good it will not the foundations are too sandy it is just that this youngster should die away sad thought for me if had not some hope that while it is dwindling may be plotting and fitting myself for verses fit to live this may be speaking too presumptuously and may deserve punishment but no feeling man will be forward to inflict it he will leave me alone with the conviction that there is not fiercer hell than the failure in great object this is not written with the least atom of purpose to forestall criticisms of course but from the desire have to conciliate men who are competent to look and who do look with zealous eye to the honor of english literature the imagination of boy is healthy and the mature imagination of man is healthy but there is space of life between in which the soul is in ferment the character undecided the way of life uncertain the ambition thick sighted thence proceeds mawkishness and all the thousand bitters which those men speak of must necessarily

april 10 1818 footnote woodhouse notes for wish to try once more this alluded to his then intention of writing poem on the fall of hyperion he commenced this poem but thanks to the critics who fell foul of this work he discontinued it the fragment was published in 1820', 'Poem_for_Human': 'A thing of beauty is a joy for ever:\\nIts loveliness increases; it will never\\nPass into nothingness; but still will keep\\nA bower quiet for us, and a sleep\\nFull of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.\\nTherefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing\\nA flowery band to bind us to the earth,\\nSpite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth\\nOf noble natures, of the gloomy days,\\nOf all the unhealthy and o\\'er-darkened ways\\nMade for our searching: yes, in spite of all,\\nSome shape of beauty moves away the pall\\nFrom our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon,\\nTrees old and young, sprouting a shady boon\\nFor simple sheep; and such are daffodils\\nWith the green world they live in; and clear rills\\nThat for themselves a cooling covert make\\n\\'Gainst the hot season; the mid forest brake,\\nRich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms:\\nAnd such too is the grandeur of the dooms\\nWe have imagined for the mighty dead;\\nAll lovely tales that we have heard or read:\\nAn endless fountain of immortal drink,\\nPouring unto us from the heaven\\'s brink.\\n\\n\\xa0 Nor do we merely feel these essences\\nFor one short hour; no, even as the trees\\nThat whisper round a temple become soon\\nDear as the temple\\'s self, so does the moon,\\nThe passion poesy, glories infinite,\\nHaunt us till they become a cheering light\\nUnto our souls, and bound to us so fast,\\nThat, whether there be shine, or gloom o\\'ercast,\\nThey alway must be with us, or we die.\\n\\n\\xa0 Therefore, \\'tis with full happiness that I\\nWill trace the story of Endymion.\\nThe very music of the name has gone\\nInto my being, and each pleasant scene\\nIs growing fresh before me as the green\\nOf our own vallies: so I will begin\\nNow while I cannot hear the city\\'s din;\\nNow while the early budders are just new,\\nAnd run in mazes of the youngest hue\\nAbout old forests; while the willow trails\\nIts delicate amber; and the dairy pails\\nBring home increase of milk. And, as the year\\nGrows lush in juicy stalks, I\\'ll smoothly steer\\nMy little boat, for many quiet hours,\\nWith streams that deepen freshly into bowers.\\nMany and many a verse I hope to write,\\nBefore the daisies, vermeil rimm\\'d and white,\\nHide in deep herbage; and ere yet the bees\\nHum about globes of clover and sweet peas,\\nI must be near the middle of my story.\\nO may no wintry season, bare and hoary,\\nSee it half finished: but let Autumn bold,\\nWith universal tinge of sober gold,\\nBe all about me when I make an end.\\nAnd now at once, adventuresome, I send\\nMy herald thought into a wilderness:\\nThere let its trumpet blow, and quickly dress\\nMy uncertain path with green, that I may speed\\nEasily onward, thorough flowers and weed.\\n\\n\\xa0 Upon the sides of Latmos was outspread\\nA mighty forest; for the moist earth fed\\nSo plenteously all weed-hidden roots\\nInto o\\'er-hanging boughs, and precious fruits.\\nAnd it had gloomy shades, sequestered deep,\\nWhere no man went; and if from shepherd\\'s keep\\nA lamb strayed far a-down those inmost glens,\\nNever again saw he the happy pens\\nWhither his brethren, bleating with content,\\nOver the hills at every nightfall went.\\nAmong the shepherds, \\'twas believed ever,\\nThat not one fleecy lamb which thus did sever\\nFrom the white flock, but pass\\'d unworried\\nBy angry wolf, or pard with prying head,\\nUntil it came to some unfooted plains\\nWhere fed the herds of Pan: ay great his gains\\nWho thus one lamb did lose. Paths there were many,\\nWinding through palmy fern, and rushes fenny,\\nAnd ivy banks; all leading pleasantly\\nTo a wide lawn, whence one could only see\\nStems thronging all around between the swell\\nOf turf and slanting branches: who could tell\\nThe freshness of the space of heaven above,\\nEdg\\'d round with dark tree tops? through which a dove\\nWould often beat its wings, and often too\\nA little cloud would move across the blue.\\n\\n\\xa0 Full in the middle of this pleasantness\\nThere stood a marble altar, with a tress\\nOf flowers budded newly; and the dew\\nHad taken fairy phantasies to strew\\nDaisies upon the sacred sward last eve,\\nAnd so the dawned light in pomp receive.\\nFor \\'twas the morn: Apollo\\'s upward fire\\nMade every eastern cloud a silvery pyre\\nOf brightness so unsullied, that therein\\nA melancholy spirit well might win\\nOblivion, and melt out his essence fine\\nInto the winds: rain-scented eglantine\\nGave temperate sweets to that well-wooing sun;\\nThe lark was lost in him; cold springs had run\\nTo warm their chilliest bubbles in the grass;\\nMan\\'s voice was on the mountains; and the mass\\nOf nature\\'s lives and wonders puls\\'d tenfold,\\nTo feel this sun-rise and its glories old.\\n\\n\\xa0 Now while the silent workings of the dawn\\nWere busiest, into that self-same lawn\\nAll suddenly, with joyful cries, there sped\\nA troop of little children garlanded;\\nWho gathering round the altar, seemed to pry\\nEarnestly round as wishing to espy\\nSome folk of holiday: nor had they waited\\nFor many moments, ere their ears were sated\\nWith a faint breath of music, which ev\\'n then\\nFill\\'d out its voice, and died away again.\\nWithin a little space again it gave\\nIts airy swellings, with a gentle wave,\\nTo light-hung leaves, in smoothest echoes breaking\\nThrough copse-clad vallies,—ere their death, oer-taking\\nThe surgy murmurs of the lonely sea.\\n\\n\\xa0 And now, as deep into the wood as we\\nMight mark a lynx\\'s eye, there glimmered light\\nFair faces and a rush of garments white,\\nPlainer and plainer shewing, till at last\\nInto the widest alley they all past,\\nMaking directly for the woodland altar.\\nO kindly muse! let not my weak tongue faulter\\nIn telling of this goodly company,\\nOf their old piety, and of their glee:\\nBut let a portion of ethereal dew\\nFall on my head, and presently unmew\\nMy soul; that I may dare, in wayfaring,\\nTo stammer where old Chaucer used to sing.\\n\\n\\xa0 Leading the way, young damsels danced along,\\nBearing the burden of a shepherd song;\\nEach having a white wicker over brimm\\'d\\nWith April\\'s tender younglings: next, well trimm\\'d,\\nA crowd of shepherds with as sunburnt looks\\nAs may be read of in Arcadian books;\\nSuch as sat listening round Apollo\\'s pipe,\\nWhen the great deity, for earth too ripe,\\nLet his divinity o\\'er-flowing die\\nIn music, through the vales of Thessaly:\\nSome idly trailed their sheep-hooks on the ground,\\nAnd some kept up a shrilly mellow sound\\nWith ebon-tipped flutes: close after these,\\nNow coming from beneath the forest trees,\\nA venerable priest full soberly,\\nBegirt with ministring looks: alway his eye\\nStedfast upon the matted turf he kept,\\nAnd after him his sacred vestments swept.\\nFrom his right hand there swung a vase, milk-white,\\nOf mingled wine, out-sparkling generous light;\\nAnd in his left he held a basket full\\nOf all sweet herbs that searching eye could cull:\\nWild thyme, and valley-lilies whiter still\\nThan Leda\\'s love, and cresses from the rill.\\nHis aged head, crowned with beechen wreath,\\nSeem\\'d like a poll of ivy in the teeth\\nOf winter hoar. Then came another crowd\\nOf shepherds, lifting in due time aloud\\nTheir share of the ditty. After them appear\\'d,\\nUp-followed by a multitude that rear\\'d\\nTheir voices to the clouds, a fair wrought car,\\nEasily rolling so as scarce to mar\\nThe freedom of three steeds of dapple brown:\\nWho stood therein did seem of great renown\\nAmong the throng. His youth was fully blown,\\nShewing like Ganymede to manhood grown;\\nAnd, for those simple times, his garments were\\nA chieftain king\\'s: beneath his breast, half bare,\\nWas hung a silver bugle, and between\\nHis nervy knees there lay a boar-spear keen.\\nA smile was on his countenance; he seem\\'d,\\nTo common lookers on, like one who dream\\'d\\nOf idleness in groves Elysian:\\nBut there were some who feelingly could scan\\nA lurking trouble in his nether lip,\\nAnd see that oftentimes the reins would slip\\nThrough his forgotten hands: then would they sigh,\\nAnd think of yellow leaves, of owlets cry,\\nOf logs piled solemnly.—Ah, well-a-day,\\nWhy should our young Endymion pine away!\\n\\n\\xa0 Soon the assembly, in a circle rang\\'d,\\nStood silent round the shrine: each look was chang\\'d\\nTo sudden veneration: women meek\\nBeckon\\'d their sons to silence; while each cheek\\nOf virgin bloom paled gently for slight fear.\\nEndymion too, without a forest peer,\\nStood, wan, and pale, and with an awed face,\\nAmong his brothers of the mountain chase.\\nIn midst of all, the venerable priest\\nEyed them with joy from greatest to the least,\\nAnd, after lifting up his aged hands,\\nThus spake he: \"Men of Latmos! shepherd bands!\\nWhose care it is to guard a thousand flocks:\\nWhether descended from beneath the rocks\\nThat overtop your mountains; whether come\\nFrom vallies where the pipe is never dumb;\\nOr from your swelling downs, where sweet air stirs\\nBlue hare-bells lightly, and where prickly furze\\nBuds lavish gold; or ye, whose precious charge\\nNibble their fill at ocean\\'s very marge,\\nWhose mellow reeds are touch\\'d with sounds forlorn\\nBy the dim echoes of old Triton\\'s horn:\\nMothers and wives! who day by day prepare\\nThe scrip, with needments, for the mountain air;\\nAnd all ye gentle girls who foster up\\nUdderless lambs, and in a little cup\\nWill put choice honey for a favoured youth:\\nYea, every one attend! for in good truth\\nOur vows are wanting to our great god Pan.\\nAre not our lowing heifers sleeker than\\nNight-swollen mushrooms? Are not our wide plains\\nSpeckled with countless fleeces? Have not rains\\nGreen\\'d over April\\'s lap? No howling sad\\nSickens our fearful ewes; and we have had\\nGreat bounty from Endymion our lord.\\nThe earth is glad: the merry lark has pour\\'d\\nHis early song against yon breezy sky,\\nThat spreads so clear o\\'er our solemnity.\"\\n\\n\\xa0 Thus ending, on the shrine he heap\\'d a spire\\nOf teeming sweets, enkindling sacred fire;\\nAnon he stain\\'d the thick and spongy sod\\nWith wine, in honour of the shepherd-god.\\nNow while the earth was drinking it, and while\\nBay leaves were crackling in the fragrant pile,\\nAnd gummy frankincense was sparkling bright\\n\\'Neath smothering parsley, and a hazy light\\nSpread greyly eastward, thus a chorus sang:\\n\\n\\xa0 \"O THOU, whose mighty palace roof doth hang\\nFrom jagged trunks, and overshadoweth\\nEternal whispers, glooms, the birth, life, death\\nOf unseen flowers in heavy peacefulness;\\nWho lov\\'st to see the hamadryads dress\\nTheir ruffled locks where meeting hazels darken;\\nAnd through whole solemn hours dost sit, and hearken\\nThe dreary melody of bedded reeds—\\nIn desolate places, where dank moisture breeds\\nThe pipy hemlock to strange overgrowth;\\nBethinking thee, how melancholy loth\\nThou wast to lose fair Syrinx—do thou now,\\nBy thy love\\'s milky brow!\\nBy all the trembling mazes that she ran,\\nHear us, great Pan!\\n\\n\\xa0 \"O thou, for whose soul-soothing quiet, turtles\\nPassion their voices cooingly \\'mong myrtles,\\nWhat time thou wanderest at eventide\\nThrough sunny meadows, that outskirt the side\\nOf thine enmossed realms: O thou, to whom\\nBroad leaved fig trees even now foredoom\\nTheir ripen\\'d fruitage; yellow girted bees\\nTheir golden honeycombs; our village leas\\nTheir fairest-blossom\\'d beans and poppied corn;\\nThe chuckling linnet its five young unborn,\\nTo sing for thee; low creeping strawberries\\nTheir summer coolness; pent up butterflies\\nTheir freckled wings; yea, the fresh budding year\\nAll its completions—be quickly near,\\nBy every wind that nods the mountain pine,\\nO forester divine!\\n\\n\\xa0 \"Thou, to whom every fawn and satyr flies\\nFor willing service; whether to surprise\\nThe squatted hare while in half sleeping fit;\\nOr upward ragged precipices flit\\nTo save poor lambkins from the eagle\\'s maw;\\nOr by mysterious enticement draw\\nBewildered shepherds to their path again;\\nOr to tread breathless round the frothy main,\\nAnd gather up all fancifullest shells\\nFor thee to tumble into Naiads\\' cells,\\nAnd, being hidden, laugh at their out-peeping;\\nOr to delight thee with fantastic leaping,\\nThe while they pelt each other on the crown\\nWith silvery oak apples, and fir cones brown—\\nBy all the echoes that about thee ring,\\nHear us, O satyr king!\\n\\n\\xa0 \"O Hearkener to the loud clapping shears,\\nWhile ever and anon to his shorn peers\\nA ram goes bleating: Winder of the horn,\\nWhen snouted wild-boars routing tender corn\\nAnger our huntsman: Breather round our farms,\\nTo keep off mildews, and all weather harms:\\nStrange ministrant of undescribed sounds,\\nThat come a swooning over hollow grounds,\\nAnd wither drearily on barren moors:\\nDread opener of the mysterious doors\\nLeading to universal knowledge—see,\\nGreat son of Dryope,\\nThe many that are come to pay their vows\\nWith leaves about their brows!\\n\\n\\xa0 Be still the unimaginable lodge\\nFor solitary thinkings; such as dodge\\nConception to the very bourne of heaven,\\nThen leave the naked brain: be still the leaven,\\nThat spreading in this dull and clodded earth\\nGives it a touch ethereal—a new birth:\\nBe still a symbol of immensity;\\nA firmament reflected in a sea;\\nAn element filling the space between;\\nAn unknown—but no more: we humbly screen\\nWith uplift hands our foreheads, lowly bending,\\nAnd giving out a shout most heaven rending,\\nConjure thee to receive our humble Paean,\\nUpon thy Mount Lycean!\\n\\n\\xa0 Even while they brought the burden to a close,\\nA shout from the whole multitude arose,\\nThat lingered in the air like dying rolls\\nOf abrupt thunder, when Ionian shoals\\nOf dolphins bob their noses through the brine.\\nMeantime, on shady levels, mossy fine,\\nYoung companies nimbly began dancing\\nTo the swift treble pipe, and humming string.\\nAye, those fair living forms swam heavenly\\nTo tunes forgotten—out of memory:\\nFair creatures! whose young children\\'s children bred\\nThermopylæ its heroes—not yet dead,\\nBut in old marbles ever beautiful.\\nHigh genitors, unconscious did they cull\\nTime\\'s sweet first-fruits—they danc\\'d to weariness,\\nAnd then in quiet circles did they press\\nThe hillock turf, and caught the latter end\\nOf some strange history, potent to send\\nA young mind from its bodily tenement.\\nOr they might watch the quoit-pitchers, intent\\nOn either side; pitying the sad death\\nOf Hyacinthus, when the cruel breath\\nOf Zephyr slew him,—Zephyr penitent,\\nWho now, ere Phoebus mounts the firmament,\\nFondles the flower amid the sobbing rain.\\nThe archers too, upon a wider plain,\\nBeside the feathery whizzing of the shaft,\\nAnd the dull twanging bowstring, and the raft\\nBranch down sweeping from a tall ash top,\\nCall\\'d up a thousand thoughts to envelope\\nThose who would watch. Perhaps, the trembling knee\\nAnd frantic gape of lonely Niobe,\\nPoor, lonely Niobe! when her lovely young\\nWere dead and gone, and her caressing tongue\\nLay a lost thing upon her paly lip,\\nAnd very, very deadliness did nip\\nHer motherly cheeks. Arous\\'d from this sad mood\\nBy one, who at a distance loud halloo\\'d,\\nUplifting his strong bow into the air,\\nMany might after brighter visions stare:\\nAfter the Argonauts, in blind amaze\\nTossing about on Neptune\\'s restless ways,\\nUntil, from the horizon\\'s vaulted side,\\nThere shot a golden splendour far and wide,\\nSpangling those million poutings of the brine\\nWith quivering ore: \\'twas even an awful shine\\nFrom the exaltation of Apollo\\'s bow;\\nA heavenly beacon in their dreary woe.\\nWho thus were ripe for high contemplating,\\nMight turn their steps towards the sober ring\\nWhere sat Endymion and the aged priest\\n\\'Mong shepherds gone in eld, whose looks increas\\'d\\nThe silvery setting of their mortal star.\\nThere they discours\\'d upon the fragile bar\\nThat keeps us from our homes ethereal;\\nAnd what our duties there: to nightly call\\nVesper, the beauty-crest of summer weather;\\nTo summon all the downiest clouds together\\nFor the sun\\'s purple couch; to emulate\\nIn ministring the potent rule of fate\\nWith speed of fire-tailed exhalations;\\nTo tint her pallid cheek with bloom, who cons\\nSweet poesy by moonlight: besides these,\\nA world of other unguess\\'d offices.\\nAnon they wander\\'d, by divine converse,\\nInto Elysium; vieing to rehearse\\nEach one his own anticipated bliss.\\nOne felt heart-certain that he could not miss\\nHis quick gone love, among fair blossom\\'d boughs,\\nWhere every zephyr-sigh pouts and endows\\nHer lips with music for the welcoming.\\nAnother wish\\'d, mid that eternal spring,\\nTo meet his rosy child, with feathery sails,\\nSweeping, eye-earnestly, through almond vales:\\nWho, suddenly, should stoop through the smooth wind,\\nAnd with the balmiest leaves his temples bind;\\nAnd, ever after, through those regions be\\nHis messenger, his little Mercury.\\nSome were athirst in soul to see again\\nTheir fellow huntsmen o\\'er the wide champaign\\nIn times long past; to sit with them, and talk\\nOf all the chances in their earthly walk;\\nComparing, joyfully, their plenteous stores\\nOf happiness, to when upon the moors,\\nBenighted, close they huddled from the cold,\\nAnd shar\\'d their famish\\'d scrips. Thus all out-told\\nTheir fond imaginations,—saving him\\nWhose eyelids curtain\\'d up their jewels dim,\\nEndymion: yet hourly had he striven\\nTo hide the cankering venom, that had riven\\nHis fainting recollections. Now indeed\\nHis senses had swoon\\'d off: he did not heed\\nThe sudden silence, or the whispers low,\\nOr the old eyes dissolving at his woe,\\nOr anxious calls, or close of trembling palms,\\nOr maiden\\'s sigh, that grief itself embalms:\\nBut in the self-same fixed trance he kept,\\nLike one who on the earth had never stept.\\nAye, even as dead-still as a marble man,\\nFrozen in that old tale Arabian.\\n\\n\\xa0 Who whispers him so pantingly and close?\\nPeona, his sweet sister: of all those,\\nHis friends, the dearest. Hushing signs she made,\\nAnd breath\\'d a sister\\'s sorrow to persuade\\nA yielding up, a cradling on her care.\\nHer eloquence did breathe away the curse:\\nShe led him, like some midnight spirit nurse\\nOf happy changes in emphatic dreams,\\nAlong a path between two little streams,—\\nGuarding his forehead, with her round elbow,\\nFrom low-grown branches, and his footsteps slow\\nFrom stumbling over stumps and hillocks small;\\nUntil they came to where these streamlets fall,\\nWith mingled bubblings and a gentle rush,\\nInto a river, clear, brimful, and flush\\nWith crystal mocking of the trees and sky.\\nA little shallop, floating there hard by,\\nPointed its beak over the fringed bank;\\nAnd soon it lightly dipt, and rose, and sank,\\nAnd dipt again, with the young couple\\'s weight,—\\nPeona guiding, through the water straight,\\nTowards a bowery island opposite;\\nWhich gaining presently, she steered light\\nInto a shady, fresh, and ripply cove,\\nWhere nested was an arbour, overwove\\nBy many a summer\\'s silent fingering;\\nTo whose cool bosom she was used to bring\\nHer playmates, with their needle broidery,\\nAnd minstrel memories of times gone by.\\n\\n\\xa0 So she was gently glad to see him laid\\nUnder her favourite bower\\'s quiet shade,\\nOn her own couch, new made of flower leaves,\\nDried carefully on the cooler side of sheaves\\nWhen last the sun his autumn tresses shook,\\nAnd the tann\\'d harvesters rich armfuls took.\\nSoon was he quieted to slumbrous rest:\\nBut, ere it crept upon him, he had prest\\nPeona\\'s busy hand against his lips,\\nAnd still, a sleeping, held her finger-tips\\nIn tender pressure. And as a willow keeps\\nA patient watch over the stream that creeps\\nWindingly by it, so the quiet maid\\nHeld her in peace: so that a whispering blade\\nOf grass, a wailful gnat, a bee bustling\\nDown in the blue-bells, or a wren light rustling\\nAmong seer leaves and twigs, might all be heard.\\n\\n\\xa0 O magic sleep! O comfortable bird,\\nThat broodest o\\'er the troubled sea of the mind\\nTill it is hush\\'d and smooth! O unconfin\\'d\\nRestraint! imprisoned liberty! great key\\nTo golden palaces, strange minstrelsy,\\nFountains grotesque, new trees, bespangled caves,\\nEchoing grottos, full of tumbling waves\\nAnd moonlight; aye, to all the mazy world\\nOf silvery enchantment!—who, upfurl\\'d\\nBeneath thy drowsy wing a triple hour,\\nBut renovates and lives?—Thus, in the bower,\\nEndymion was calm\\'d to life again.\\nOpening his eyelids with a healthier brain,\\nHe said: \"I feel this thine endearing love\\nAll through my bosom: thou art as a dove\\nTrembling its closed eyes and sleeked wings\\nAbout me; and the pearliest dew not brings\\nSuch morning incense from the fields of May,\\nAs do those brighter drops that twinkling stray\\nFrom those kind eyes,—the very home and haunt\\nOf sisterly affection. Can I want\\nAught else, aught nearer heaven, than such tears?\\nYet dry them up, in bidding hence all fears\\nThat, any longer, I will pass my days\\nAlone and sad. No, I will once more raise\\nMy voice upon the mountain-heights; once more\\nMake my horn parley from their foreheads hoar:\\nAgain my trooping hounds their tongues shall loll\\nAround the breathed boar: again I\\'ll poll\\nThe fair-grown yew tree, for a chosen bow:\\nAnd, when the pleasant sun is getting low,\\nAgain I\\'ll linger in a sloping mead\\nTo hear the speckled thrushes, and see feed\\nOur idle sheep. So be thou cheered sweet,\\nAnd, if thy lute is here, softly intreat\\nMy soul to keep in its resolved course.\"\\n\\n\\xa0 Hereat Peona, in their silver source,\\nShut her pure sorrow drops with glad exclaim,\\nAnd took a lute, from which there pulsing came\\nA lively prelude, fashioning the way\\nIn which her voice should wander. \\'Twas a lay\\nMore subtle cadenced, more forest wild\\nThan Dryope\\'s lone lulling of her child;\\nAnd nothing since has floated in the air\\nSo mournful strange. Surely some influence rare\\nWent, spiritual, through the damsel\\'s hand;\\nFor still, with Delphic emphasis, she spann\\'d\\nThe quick invisible strings, even though she saw\\nEndymion\\'s spirit melt away and thaw\\nBefore the deep intoxication.\\nBut soon she came, with sudden burst, upon\\nHer self-possession—swung the lute aside,\\nAnd earnestly said: \"Brother, \\'tis vain to hide\\nThat thou dost know of things mysterious,\\nImmortal, starry; such alone could thus\\nWeigh down thy nature. Hast thou sinn\\'d in aught\\nOffensive to the heavenly powers? Caught\\nA Paphian dove upon a message sent?\\nThy deathful bow against some deer-herd bent,\\nSacred to Dian? Haply, thou hast seen\\nHer naked limbs among the alders green;\\nAnd that, alas! is death. No, I can trace\\nSomething more high perplexing in thy face!\"\\n\\n\\xa0 Endymion look\\'d at her, and press\\'d her hand,\\nAnd said, \"Art thou so pale, who wast so bland\\nAnd merry in our meadows? How is this?\\nTell me thine ailment: tell me all amiss!—\\nAh! thou hast been unhappy at the change\\nWrought suddenly in me. What indeed more strange?\\nOr more complete to overwhelm surmise?\\nAmbition is no sluggard: \\'tis no prize,\\nThat toiling years would put within my grasp,\\nThat I have sigh\\'d for: with so deadly gasp\\nNo man e\\'er panted for a mortal love.\\nSo all have set my heavier grief above\\nThese things which happen. Rightly have they done:\\nI, who still saw the horizontal sun\\nHeave his broad shoulder o\\'er the edge of the world,\\nOut-facing Lucifer, and then had hurl\\'d\\nMy spear aloft, as signal for the chace—\\nI, who, for very sport of heart, would race\\nWith my own steed from Araby; pluck down\\nA vulture from his towery perching; frown\\nA lion into growling, loth retire—\\nTo lose, at once, all my toil breeding fire,\\nAnd sink thus low! but I will ease my breast\\nOf secret grief, here in this bowery nest.\\n\\n\\xa0 \"This river does not see the naked sky,\\nTill it begins to progress silverly\\nAround the western border of the wood,\\nWhence, from a certain spot, its winding flood\\nSeems at the distance like a crescent moon:\\nAnd in that nook, the very pride of June,\\nHad I been used to pass my weary eves;\\nThe rather for the sun unwilling leaves\\nSo dear a picture of his sovereign power,\\nAnd I could witness his most kingly hour,\\nWhen he doth lighten up the golden reins,\\nAnd paces leisurely down amber plains\\nHis snorting four. Now when his chariot last\\nIts beams against the zodiac-lion cast,\\nThere blossom\\'d suddenly a magic bed\\nOf sacred ditamy, and poppies red:\\nAt which I wondered greatly, knowing well\\nThat but one night had wrought this flowery spell;\\nAnd, sitting down close by, began to muse\\nWhat it might mean. Perhaps, thought I, Morpheus,\\nIn passing here, his owlet pinions shook;\\nOr, it may be, ere matron Night uptook\\nHer ebon urn, young Mercury, by stealth,\\nHad dipt his rod in it: such garland wealth\\nCame not by common growth. Thus on I thought,\\nUntil my head was dizzy and distraught.\\nMoreover, through the dancing poppies stole\\nA breeze, most softly lulling to my soul;\\nAnd shaping visions all about my sight\\nOf colours, wings, and bursts of spangly light;\\nThe which became more strange, and strange, and dim,\\nAnd then were gulph\\'d in a tumultuous swim:\\nAnd then I fell asleep. Ah, can I tell\\nThe enchantment that afterwards befel?\\nYet it was but a dream: yet such a dream\\nThat never tongue, although it overteem\\nWith mellow utterance, like a cavern spring,\\nCould figure out and to conception bring\\nAll I beheld and felt. Methought I lay\\nWatching the zenith, where the milky way\\nAmong the stars in virgin splendour pours;\\nAnd travelling my eye, until the doors\\nOf heaven appear\\'d to open for my flight,\\nI became loth and fearful to alight\\nFrom such high soaring by a downward glance:\\nSo kept me stedfast in that airy trance,\\nSpreading imaginary pinions wide.\\nWhen, presently, the stars began to glide,\\nAnd faint away, before my eager view:\\nAt which I sigh\\'d that I could not pursue,\\nAnd dropt my vision to the horizon\\'s verge;\\nAnd lo! from opening clouds, I saw emerge\\nThe loveliest moon, that ever silver\\'d o\\'er\\nA shell for Neptune\\'s goblet: she did soar\\nSo passionately bright, my dazzled soul\\nCommingling with her argent spheres did roll\\nThrough clear and cloudy, even when she went\\nAt last into a dark and vapoury tent—\\nWhereat, methought, the lidless-eyed train\\nOf planets all were in the blue again.\\nTo commune with those orbs, once more I rais\\'d\\nMy sight right upward: but it was quite dazed\\nBy a bright something, sailing down apace,\\nMaking me quickly veil my eyes and face:\\nAgain I look\\'d, and, O ye deities,\\nWho from Olympus watch our destinies!\\nWhence that completed form of all completeness?\\nWhence came that high perfection of all sweetness?\\nSpeak, stubborn earth, and tell me where, O Where\\nHast thou a symbol of her golden hair?\\nNot oat-sheaves drooping in the western sun;\\nNot—thy soft hand, fair sister! let me shun\\nSuch follying before thee—yet she had,\\nIndeed, locks bright enough to make me mad;\\nAnd they were simply gordian\\'d up and braided,\\nLeaving, in naked comeliness, unshaded,\\nHer pearl round ears, white neck, and orbed brow;\\nThe which were blended in, I know not how,\\nWith such a paradise of lips and eyes,\\nBlush-tinted cheeks, half smiles, and faintest sighs,\\nThat, when I think thereon, my spirit clings\\nAnd plays about its fancy, till the stings\\nOf human neighbourhood envenom all.\\nUnto what awful power shall I call?\\nTo what high fane?—Ah! see her hovering feet,\\nMore bluely vein\\'d, more soft, more whitely sweet\\nThan those of sea-born Venus, when she rose\\nFrom out her cradle shell. The wind out-blows\\nHer scarf into a fluttering pavilion;\\n\\'Tis blue, and over-spangled with a million\\nOf little eyes, as though thou wert to shed,\\nOver the darkest, lushest blue-bell bed,\\nHandfuls of daisies.\"—\"Endymion, how strange!\\nDream within dream!\"—\"She took an airy range,\\nAnd then, towards me, like a very maid,\\nCame blushing, waning, willing, and afraid,\\nAnd press\\'d me by the hand: Ah! \\'twas too much;\\nMethought I fainted at the charmed touch,\\nYet held my recollection, even as one\\nWho dives three fathoms where the waters run\\nGurgling in beds of coral: for anon,\\nI felt upmounted in that region\\nWhere falling stars dart their artillery forth,\\nAnd eagles struggle with the buffeting north\\nThat balances the heavy meteor-stone;—\\nFelt too, I was not fearful, nor alone,\\nBut lapp\\'d and lull\\'d along the dangerous sky.\\nSoon, as it seem\\'d, we left our journeying high,\\nAnd straightway into frightful eddies swoop\\'d;\\nSuch as ay muster where grey time has scoop\\'d\\nHuge dens and caverns in a mountain\\'s side:\\nThere hollow sounds arous\\'d me, and I sigh\\'d\\nTo faint once more by looking on my bliss—\\nI was distracted; madly did I kiss\\nThe wooing arms which held me, and did give\\nMy eyes at once to death: but \\'twas to live,\\nTo take in draughts of life from the gold fount\\nOf kind and passionate looks; to count, and count\\nThe moments, by some greedy help that seem\\'d\\nA second self, that each might be redeem\\'d\\nAnd plunder\\'d of its load of blessedness.\\nAh, desperate mortal! I ev\\'n dar\\'d to press\\nHer very cheek against my crowned lip,\\nAnd, at that moment, felt my body dip\\nInto a warmer air: a moment more,\\nOur feet were soft in flowers. There was store\\nOf newest joys upon that alp. Sometimes\\nA scent of violets, and blossoming limes,\\nLoiter\\'d around us; then of honey cells,\\nMade delicate from all white-flower bells;\\nAnd once, above the edges of our nest,\\nAn arch face peep\\'d,—an Oread as I guess\\'d.\\n\\n\\xa0 \"Why did I dream that sleep o\\'er-power\\'d me\\nIn midst of all this heaven? Why not see,\\nFar off, the shadows of his pinions dark,\\nAnd stare them from me? But no, like a spark\\nThat needs must die, although its little beam\\nReflects upon a diamond, my sweet dream\\nFell into nothing—into stupid sleep.\\nAnd so it was, until a gentle creep,\\nA careful moving caught my waking ears,\\nAnd up I started: Ah! my sighs, my tears,\\nMy clenched hands;—for lo! the poppies hung\\nDew-dabbled on their stalks, the ouzel sung\\nA heavy ditty, and the sullen day\\nHad chidden herald Hesperus away,\\nWith leaden looks: the solitary breeze\\nBluster\\'d, and slept, and its wild self did teaze\\nWith wayward melancholy; and r thought,\\nMark me, Peona! that sometimes it brought\\nFaint fare-thee-wells, and sigh-shrilled adieus!—\\nAway I wander\\'d—all the pleasant hues\\nOf heaven and earth had faded: deepest shades\\nWere deepest dungeons; heaths and sunny glades\\nWere full of pestilent light; our taintless rills\\nSeem\\'d sooty, and o\\'er-spread with upturn\\'d gills\\nOf dying fish; the vermeil rose had blown\\nIn frightful scarlet, and its thorns out-grown\\nLike spiked aloe. If an innocent bird\\nBefore my heedless footsteps stirr\\'d, and stirr\\'d\\nIn little journeys, I beheld in it\\nA disguis\\'d demon, missioned to knit\\nMy soul with under darkness; to entice\\nMy stumblings down some monstrous precipice:\\nTherefore I eager followed, and did curse\\nThe disappointment. Time, that aged nurse,\\nRock\\'d me to patience. Now, thank gentle heaven!\\nThese things, with all their comfortings, are given\\nTo my down-sunken hours, and with thee,\\nSweet sister, help to stem the ebbing sea\\nOf weary life.\"\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Thus ended he, and both\\nSat silent: for the maid was very loth\\nTo answer; feeling well that breathed words\\nWould all be lost, unheard, and vain as swords\\nAgainst the enchased crocodile, or leaps\\nOf grasshoppers against the sun. She weeps,\\nAnd wonders; struggles to devise some blame;\\nTo put on such a look as would say, Shame\\nOn this poor weakness! but, for all her strife,\\nShe could as soon have crush\\'d away the life\\nFrom a sick dove. At length, to break the pause,\\nShe said with trembling chance: \"Is this the cause?\\nThis all? Yet it is strange, and sad, alas!\\nThat one who through this middle earth should pass\\nMost like a sojourning demi-god, and leave\\nHis name upon the harp-string, should achieve\\nNo higher bard than simple maidenhood,\\nSinging alone, and fearfully,—how the blood\\nLeft his young cheek; and how he used to stray\\nHe knew not where; and how he would say, nay,\\nIf any said \\'twas love: and yet \\'twas love;\\nWhat could it be but love? How a ring-dove\\nLet fall a sprig of yew tree in his path;\\nAnd how he died: and then, that love doth scathe,\\nThe gentle heart, as northern blasts do roses;\\nAnd then the ballad of his sad life closes\\nWith sighs, and an alas!—Endymion!\\nBe rather in the trumpet\\'s mouth,—anon\\nAmong the winds at large—that all may hearken!\\nAlthough, before the crystal heavens darken,\\nI watch and dote upon the silver lakes\\nPictur\\'d in western cloudiness, that takes\\nThe semblance of gold rocks and bright gold sands,\\nIslands, and creeks, and amber-fretted strands\\nWith horses prancing o\\'er them, palaces\\nAnd towers of amethyst,—would I so tease\\nMy pleasant days, because I could not mount\\nInto those regions? The Morphean fount\\nOf that fine element that visions, dreams,\\nAnd fitful whims of sleep are made of, streams\\nInto its airy channels with so subtle,\\nSo thin a breathing, not the spider\\'s shuttle,\\nCircled a million times within the space\\nOf a swallow\\'s nest-door, could delay a trace,\\nA tinting of its quality: how light\\nMust dreams themselves be; seeing they\\'re more slight\\nThan the mere nothing that engenders them!\\nThen wherefore sully the entrusted gem\\nOf high and noble life with thoughts so sick?\\nWhy pierce high-fronted honour to the quick\\nFor nothing but a dream?\" Hereat the youth\\nLook\\'d up: a conflicting of shame and ruth\\nWas in his plaited brow: yet his eyelids\\nWidened a little, as when Zephyr bids\\nA little breeze to creep between the fans\\nOf careless butterflies: amid his pains\\nHe seem\\'d to taste a drop of manna-dew,\\nFull palatable; and a colour grew\\nUpon his cheek, while thus he lifeful spake.\\n\\n\\xa0 \"Peona! ever have I long\\'d to slake\\nMy thirst for the world\\'s praises: nothing base,\\nNo merely slumberous phantasm, could unlace\\nThe stubborn canvas for my voyage prepar\\'d—\\nThough now \\'tis tatter\\'d; leaving my bark bar\\'d\\nAnd sullenly drifting: yet my higher hope\\nIs of too wide, too rainbow-large a scope,\\nTo fret at myriads of earthly wrecks.\\nWherein lies happiness?

Leigh Hunt records that the elder poet pronounced it \"a very pretty piece of paganism.\"\\n(line 319): Doubtless meant to refer specially to the Elgin marbles.\\n(line 347): The reference here is to the passage from the second Book of the Argonautica of Apollonius Rhodius, beginning at verse 674 ... which Shelley had in mind when (Prose Works, Vol. 3, p. 56) he alluded to the Apollo \"so finely described by Apollonius Rhodius when the dazzling radiance of his beautiful limbs suddenly shone over the dark Euxine.\"\\n __ note found before the Preface of Endymion, in the Poetical Works of John Keats, ed.

The statement corresponds with Keats\\'s own record of May 1817, that he was busying himself at Margate with the commencement of Endymion.\\'\\nPREFACE. \\nKnowing within myself the manner in which this Poem has been produced, it is not without a feeling of regret that I make it public. \\nWhat manner I mean, will be quite clear to the reader, who must soon perceive great inexperience, immaturity, and every error denoting a feverish attempt, rather than a deed accomplished. The two first books, and indeed the two last, I feel sensible are not of such completion as to warrant their passing the press; nor should they if I thought a year\\'s castigation would do them any good; -- it will not: the foundations are too sandy. It is just that this youngster should die away: a sad thought for me, if I had not some hope that while it is dwindling I may be plotting, and fitting myself for verses fit to live.\\nThis may be speaking too presumptuously, and may deserve a punishment: but no feeling man will be forward to inflict it: he will leave me alone, with the conviction that there is not a fiercer hell than the failure in a great object. This is not written with the least atom of purpose to forestall criticisms of course, but from the desire I have to conciliate men who are competent to look, and who do look with a zealous eye, to the honor of English literature.\\nThe imagination of a boy is healthy, and the mature imagination of a man is healthy; but there is a space of life between, in which the soul is in a ferment, the character undecided, the way of life uncertain, the ambition thick-sighted: thence proceeds mawkishness, and all the thousand bitters which those men I speak of must necessarily taste in going over the following pages.\\nI hope I have not in too late a day touched the beautiful mythology of Greece, and dulled its brightness: for I wish to try once more, before I bid it farewell.\\nTeignmouth, April 10, 1818.\\n[footnote] Woodhouse notes -- \"[for I wish to try once more,] This alluded to his then intention of writing a poem on the fall of Hyperion.

The evidence of the manuscript on this point is of consequence as bearing on the relative positions of this sonnet and that \\'On first looking into Chapman\\'s Homer\\'.I understand the \"giant ignorance\" of line I to have reference to Keats\\'s inability to enjoy Homer in the original Greek, and not to an entire ignorance of the Iliad and Odyssey such as might have characterized the period before the sonnet on Chapman\\'s version was written in 1816. Indeed the second quatrain seems to me to be too well felt for so vague an attitude as Keats\\'s must have been towards Homer before he knew any version at all; but the late Dante Gabriel Rossetti, whose intuitions in such matters were of the keenest, and entitled to the most careful consideration, held that the present sonnet must have preceded that of 1816, and received with considerable reserve the evidence as to the date which I communicated to him in the course of our correspondence.  It will be of interest to many lovers both of Keats and of Rossetti to learn that the latter poet whom we have but lately lost considered this sonnet to contain Keats\\'s finest single line of poetry -- \\'There is a budding morrow in midnight,\\'a line which Rossetti told me he thought one of the finest \"in all poetry.\" No one will dispute that it is a most astonishing line, more particularly for a young man of Keats\\'s years in 1818.\\' ~ Poetical Works of John Keats, ed.

They then pushed on to Oban, \"15 miles in a soaking rain\" -- due north again. At Oban Keats finished the unpublished letter to Tom containing The Gadfly and the Stranger sonnet, and posted it, announcing that the travellers had given up the idea of Mull and Staffa on account of the expense. This was probably on the 22nd of July.  On the 23rd he begins a fresh letter (Life, Letters &c.) stating that just after he had posted the other the guide to Mull came in and made a bargain with them. This latter letter is dated the 23rd of July, \"Dunancullen\" in the Life: \"Dimancullen\" is the name given in the same connexion in the New York World, where some Keats documents appeared; but probably the place indicated is Derrynaculen, which is at a situation on the walk through the southern part of the Isle of Mull corresponding with Keats\\'s narrative.  This narrative seems to show that on the 23rd of July they crossed from Oban to Kerrera by one ferry and from Kerrera to Mull by another, and walked across the south of the Island to the western extremity to cross to Iona by boat. By the 26th, Keats resumed his letter to Tom at Oban, and narrated that the thirty-seven miles of walking had been very miserable, and that he and Brown had taken a boat at a bargain to carry them from Iona to Staffa, and land them finally at the head of Loch Nakeal, whence they could return to Oban by a better route. He vividly describes Staffa, including Fingal\\'s Cave, breaks into verse with the lines given above, and resumes prose with,\"I am sorry I am so indolent as to write such stuff as this.\" Probably the poem should be dated the 26th of July, 1818.\\'~ Poetical Works of John Keats, ed.

after the death of tom keats when the poet took up his residence at wentworth place line 14 it seems to me that the power of realization shown in the first decade and indeed throughout the fragment answers all objections to the subject and is the most absolute security for the nobility of the result which keats would have achieved had he finished the poem it is impossible to over estimate the value of such landscape so touched in with few strokes of titanic meaning and completeness and the whole sentiment of gigantic despair reflected around the fallen god of the titan dynasty and permeating the landscape is resumed in the most perfect manner in the incident of the motionless fallen leaf line almost as intense and full of the essence of poetry as any line in our language it were ungracious to take exception to the poor naiad but she has not the convincing appropriateness of the rest of this sublime opening line 51 leigh hunt remarks upon keats failure to finish the poem are specially appropriate to this passage if any living poet could finish this fragment we believe it is the author himself but perhaps he feels that he ought not story which involves passion almost

On he flared\\nFrom stately nave to nave, from vault to vault,\\nThrough bowers of fragrant and enwreathed light,\\nAnd diamond-paved lustrous long arcades,\\nUntil he reach\\'d the great main cupola;\\nThere standing fierce beneath, he stampt his foot,\\nAnd from the basements deep to the high towers\\nJarr\\'d his own golden region; and before\\nThe quavering thunder thereupon had ceas\\'d,\\nHis voice leapt out, despite of godlike curb,\\nTo this result: \"O dreams of day and night!\\nO monstrous forms!

It is impossible to over-estimate the value of such a landscape, so touched in with a few strokes of titanic meaning and completeness; and the whole sentiment of gigantic despair reflected around the fallen god of the Titan dynasty, and permeating the landscape, is resumed in the most perfect manner in the incident of the motionless fallen leaf, a line almost as intense and full of the essence of poetry as any line in our language. It were ungracious to take exception to the poor Naiad; but she has not the convincing appropriateness of the rest of this sublime opening.\\'\\n\\n(line 51): Leigh Hunt\\'s remarks upon Keats\\'s failure to finish the poem are specially appropriate to this passage, \"If any living poet could finish this fragment, we believe it is the author himself. But perhaps he feels that he ought not. A story which involves passion, almost of necessity involves speech; and though we may well enough describe beings greater than ourselves by comparison, unfortunately we cannot make them speak by comparison.\"\\n\\n\\n~ Poetical Works of John Keats, ed.

to find the vile brethren of isabella talking in metaphor than to find them talking in rhyme and metre for the rest common place italian even villainous italian feels so intensely the sunlight of his land that we need not object to the metaphor even on dramatic grounds stanza xxxiii for hinnom vale see second book of chronicles of the kings of israel chapter xxviii verse moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of hinnom and burnt his children in the fire after the abominations of the heathen whom the lord had cast out before the children of israel stanza xlvii the sixth line has been topic of censure but think wrongly taken in itself apart from the poem it might be held to be an inopportune description but in the context of this most tragic and pathetic story it has to me surpassing fitness fitness astonishing in the work of youth of keats age in 1818 the idea of maternity thus connected as it were by chance with the image of this widowed girl on the borders of insanity emphasizes in the most beautiful way the helpless misery of life wrecked by the wickedness of others and throws into ghastly contrast the joy of what should have been and the agony of what was stanza xlviii hunt observes here it is curious to see how the simple pathos of boccaccio or which is the same thing the simple intensity of the heroine feelings suffices our author more and more as he gets to the end of his story and he has related it as happily as if he had never written any poetry but that of the heart stanza liv whether the savage and tartarly assailants of keats day availed themselves of the word leafits in the 8th line for an accusation of word coining do not know but as far as have been able to ascertain this diminutive of leaf is peculiar to the present passage stanza lxii hunt says the passage about the tone of her voice the poor lost witted coaxing the chuckle in which she asks after her pilgrim and her basil is as true and touching an instance of the effect of happy familiar word as any in all poetry it is difficult to imagine that these sentences of hunt were not somehow misprinted but as the review occurs only in the original issue of the indicator one has no means of testing this passage by comparison with later editions it can hardly be supposed that hunt really thought the pilgrim meant lorenzo and it ought not to be necessary to explain that the poor lost girl called after any pilgrim whom chance sent her way enquiring of him where her basil was poetical works of john keats ed buxton forman crowell publ 1895',

could not sit at meals but feel how well\\nIt soothed each to be the other by;\\nThey could not, sure, beneath the same roof sleep\\nBut to each other dream, and nightly weep.\\n\\nII.\\nWith every morn their love grew tenderer,\\nWith every eve deeper and tenderer still;\\nHe might not in house, field, or garden stir,\\nBut her full shape would all his seeing fill;\\nAnd his continual voice was pleasanter\\nTo her, than noise of trees or hidden rill;\\nHer lute-string gave an echo of his name,\\nShe spoilt her half-done broidery with the same.\\n\\nIII.\\nHe knew whose gentle hand was at the latch,\\nBefore the door had given her to his eyes;\\nAnd from her chamber-window he would catch\\nHer beauty farther than the falcon spies;\\nAnd constant as her vespers would he watch,\\nBecause her face was turn\\'d to the same skies;\\nAnd with sick longing all the night outwear,\\nTo hear her morning-step upon the stair.\\n\\nIV.\\nA whole long month of May in this sad plight\\nMade their cheeks paler by the break of June:\\n\"To morrow will I bow to my delight,\\n\"To-morrow will I ask my lady\\'s boon.\"—\\n\"O may I never see another night,\\n\"Lorenzo, if thy lips breathe not

domain,\\nFell thin as a young mother\\'s, who doth seek\\nBy every lull to cool her infant\\'s pain:\\n\"How ill she is,\" said he, \"I may not speak,\\n\"And yet I will, and tell my love all plain:\\n\"If looks speak love-laws, I will drink her tears,\\n\"And at the least \\'twill startle off her cares.\"\\n\\nVI.\\nSo said he one fair morning, and all day\\nHis heart beat awfully against his side;\\nAnd to his heart he inwardly did pray\\nFor power to speak; but still the ruddy tide\\nStifled his voice, and puls\\'d resolve away—\\nFever\\'d his high conceit of such a bride,\\nYet brought him to the meekness of a child:\\nAlas! when passion is both meek and wild!\\n\\nVII.\\nSo once more he had wak\\'d and anguished\\nA dreary night of love and misery,\\nIf Isabel\\'s quick eye had not been wed\\nTo every symbol on his forehead high;\\nShe saw it waxing very pale and dead,\\nAnd straight all flush\\'d; so, lisped tenderly,\\n\"Lorenzo!\"—here she ceas\\'d her timid quest,\\nBut in her tone and look he read the rest.\\n\\nVIII.\\n\"O Isabella, I can half perceive\\n\"That I may speak my grief into thine ear;\\n\"If thou didst ever any thing believe,\\n\"Believe

to her chamber gone, a ditty fair\\nSang, of delicious love and honey\\'d dart;\\nHe with light steps went up a western hill,\\nAnd bade the sun farewell, and joy\\'d his fill.\\n\\nXI.\\nAll close they met again, before the dusk\\nHad taken from the stars its pleasant veil,\\nAll close they met, all eves, before the dusk\\nHad taken from the stars its pleasant veil,\\nClose in a bower of hyacinth and musk,\\nUnknown of any, free from whispering tale.\\nAh! better had it been for ever so,\\nThan idle ears should pleasure in their woe.\\n\\nXII.\\nWere they unhappy then?—It cannot be—\\nToo many tears for lovers have been shed,\\nToo many sighs give we to them in fee,\\nToo much of pity after they are dead,\\nToo many doleful stories do we see,\\nWhose matter in bright gold

sharp racks at work, to pinch and peel.\\n\\nXVI.\\nWhy were they proud? Because their marble founts\\nGush\\'d with more pride than do a wretch\\'s tears?—\\nWhy were they proud? Because fair orange-mounts\\nWere of more soft ascent than lazar stairs?—\\nWhy were they proud? Because red-lin\\'d accounts\\nWere richer than the songs of Grecian years?—\\nWhy were they proud? again we ask aloud,\\nWhy in the name of Glory were they proud?\\n\\nXVII.\\nYet were these Florentines as self-retired\\nIn hungry pride and gainful cowardice,\\nAs two close Hebrews in that land inspired,\\nPaled in and vineyarded from beggar-spies,\\nThe hawks of ship-mast forests—the untired\\nAnd pannier\\'d mules for ducats and old lies—\\nQuick cat\\'s-paws on the generous stray-away,—\\nGreat wits in Spanish, Tuscan, and Malay.\\n\\nXVIII.\\nHow was it these same ledger-men could spy\\nFair Isabella in her downy nest?\\nHow could they find out in Lorenzo\\'s eye\\nA straying from his toil? Hot Egypt\\'s pest\\nInto their vision covetous and sly!\\nHow could these money-bags see east and west?—\\nYet so they did—and every dealer fair\\nMust see behind, as doth the hunted hare.\\n\\nXIX.\\nO eloquent and famed Boccaccio!\\nOf thee we now should ask forgiving boon,\\nAnd of thy spicy myrtles as they blow,\\nAnd of thy roses amorous of the moon,\\nAnd of thy lilies, that do paler grow\\nNow they can no more hear thy ghittern\\'s tune,\\nFor venturing syllables that ill beseem\\nThe quiet glooms of such a piteous theme.\\n\\nXX.\\nGrant thou a pardon here, and then the tale\\nShall move on soberly, as it is meet;\\nThere is no other crime, no mad assail\\nTo make old prose in modern rhyme more sweet:\\nBut it is done—succeed the verse or fail—\\nTo honour thee, and thy gone spirit greet;\\nTo stead thee as a verse in English tongue,\\nAn echo of thee in the north-wind sung.\\n\\nXXI.\\nThese brethren having found by many signs\\nWhat love Lorenzo for their sister had,\\nAnd how she lov\\'d him too, each unconfines\\nHis bitter thoughts to other, well nigh mad\\nThat he, the servant of their trade designs,\\nShould in their sister\\'s love be blithe and glad,\\nWhen \\'twas their plan to coax her by degrees\\nTo some high noble and his olive-trees.\\n\\nXXII.\\nAnd many a jealous conference had they,\\nAnd many times they bit their lips alone,\\nBefore they fix\\'d upon a surest way\\nTo make the youngster for his crime atone;\\nAnd at the last, these men of cruel clay\\nCut Mercy with a sharp knife to the bone;\\nFor they resolved in some forest dim\\nTo kill Lorenzo, and there bury him.\\n\\nXXIII.\\nSo on a pleasant morning, as he leant\\nInto the sun-rise, o\\'er the balustrade\\nOf the garden-terrace, towards him they bent\\nTheir footing through the dews; and to him said,\\n\"You seem there in the quiet of content,\\n\"Lorenzo, and we are most loth to invade\\n\"Calm speculation; but if you are wise,\\n\"Bestride your steed while cold is in the skies.\\n\\nXXIV.\\n\"To-day we purpose, ay, this hour we mount\\n\"To spur three leagues towards the Apennine;\\n\"Come down, we pray thee, ere the hot sun count\\n\"His dewy rosary on the eglantine.\"\\nLorenzo, courteously as he was wont,\\nBow\\'d a fair greeting to these serpents\\' whine;\\nAnd went in haste, to get in readiness,\\nWith belt, and spur, and bracing huntsman\\'s dress.\\n\\nXXV.\\nAnd as he to the court-yard pass\\'d along,\\nEach third step did he pause, and listen\\'d oft\\nIf he could hear his lady\\'s matin-song,\\nOr the light whisper of her footstep soft;\\nAnd as he thus over his passion hung,\\nHe heard a laugh full musical aloft;\\nWhen, looking up, he saw her features bright\\nSmile through an in-door lattice, all delight.\\n\\nXXVI.\\n\"Love, Isabel!\" said he, \"I was in pain\\n\"Lest I should miss to bid thee a good morrow:\\n\"Ah! what if I should lose thee, when so fain\\n\"I am to stifle all the heavy sorrow\\n\"Of a poor three hours\\' absence? but we\\'ll gain\\n\"Out of the amorous dark what day doth borrow.\\n\"Good bye! I\\'ll soon be back.\"—\"Good bye!\" said she:—\\nAnd as he went she chanted merrily.\\n\\nXXVII.\\nSo the two brothers and their murder\\'d man\\nRode past fair Florence, to where Arno\\'s stream\\nGurgles through straiten\\'d banks, and still doth fan\\nItself with dancing bulrush, and the bream\\nKeeps head against the freshets. Sick and wan\\nThe brothers\\' faces in the ford did seem,\\nLorenzo\\'s flush with love.—They pass\\'d the water\\nInto a forest quiet for the slaughter.\\n\\nXXVIII.\\nThere was Lorenzo slain and buried in,\\nThere in that forest did his great love cease;\\nAh! when a soul doth thus its freedom win,\\nIt aches in loneliness—is ill at peace\\nAs the break-covert blood-hounds of such sin:\\nThey dipp\\'d their swords in the water, and did tease\\nTheir horses homeward, with convulsed spur,\\nEach richer by his being a murderer.\\n\\nXXIX.\\nThey told their sister how, with sudden speed,\\nLorenzo had ta\\'en ship for foreign lands,\\nBecause of some great urgency and need\\nIn their affairs, requiring trusty hands.\\nPoor Girl! put on thy stifling widow\\'s weed,\\nAnd \\'scape at once from Hope\\'s accursed bands;\\nTo-day thou wilt not see him, nor to-morrow,\\nAnd the next day will be a day of sorrow.\\n\\nXXX.\\nShe weeps alone for pleasures not to be;\\nSorely she wept until the night came on,\\nAnd then, instead of love, O misery!\\nShe brooded o\\'er the luxury alone:\\nHis image in the dusk she seem\\'d to see,\\nAnd to the silence made a gentle moan,\\nSpreading her perfect arms upon the air,\\nAnd on her couch low murmuring, \"Where? O where?\"\\n\\nXXXI.\\nBut Selfishness, Love\\'s cousin, held not long\\nIts fiery vigil in her single breast;\\nShe fretted for the golden hour, and hung\\nUpon the time with feverish unrest—\\nNot long—for soon into her heart a throng\\nOf higher occupants, a richer zest,\\nCame tragic; passion not to be subdued,\\nAnd sorrow for her love in travels rude.\\n\\nXXXII.\\nIn the mid days of autumn, on their eves\\nThe breath of Winter comes from far away,\\nAnd the sick west continually bereaves\\nOf some gold tinge, and plays a roundelay\\nOf death among the bushes and the leaves,\\nTo make all bare before he dares to stray\\nFrom his north cavern. So sweet Isabel\\nBy gradual decay from beauty fell,\\n\\nXXXIII.\\nBecause Lorenzo came not. Oftentimes\\nShe ask\\'d her brothers, with an eye all pale,\\nStriving to be itself, what dungeon climes\\nCould keep him off so long? They spake a tale\\nTime after time, to quiet her. Their crimes\\nCame on them, like a smoke from Hinnom\\'s vale;\\nAnd every night in dreams they groan\\'d aloud,\\nTo see their sister in her snowy shroud.\\n\\nXXXIV.\\nAnd she had died in drowsy ignorance,\\nBut for a thing more deadly dark than all;\\nIt came like a fierce potion, drunk by chance,\\nWhich saves a sick man from the feather\\'d pall\\nFor some few gasping moments; like a lance,\\nWaking an Indian from his cloudy hall\\nWith cruel pierce, and bringing him again\\nSense of the gnawing fire at heart and brain.\\n\\nXXXV.\\nIt was a vision.—In the drowsy gloom,\\nThe dull of midnight, at her couch\\'s foot\\nLorenzo stood, and wept: the forest tomb\\nHad marr\\'d his glossy hair which once could shoot\\nLustre into the sun, and put cold doom\\nUpon his lips, and taken the soft lute\\nFrom his lorn voice, and past his loamed ears\\nHad made a miry channel for his tears.\\n\\nXXXVI.\\nStrange sound it was, when the pale shadow spake;\\nFor there was striving, in its piteous tongue,\\nTo speak as when on earth it was awake,\\nAnd Isabella on its music hung:\\nLanguor there was in it, and tremulous shake,\\nAs in a palsied Druid\\'s harp unstrung;\\nAnd through it moan\\'d a ghostly under-song,\\nLike hoarse night-gusts sepulchral briars among.\\n\\nXXXVII.\\nIts eyes, though wild, were still all dewy bright\\nWith love, and kept all phantom fear aloof\\nFrom the poor girl by magic of their light,\\nThe while it did unthread the horrid woof\\nOf the late darken\\'d time,—the murderous spite\\nOf pride and avarice,—the dark pine roof\\nIn the forest,—and the sodden turfed dell,\\nWhere, without any word, from stabs he fell.\\n\\nXXXVIII.\\nSaying moreover, \"Isabel, my sweet!\\n\"Red whortle-berries droop above my head,\\n\"And a large flint-stone weighs upon my feet;\\n\"Around me beeches and high chestnuts shed\\n\"Their leaves and prickly nuts; a sheep-fold bleat\\n\"Comes from beyond the river to my bed:\\n\"Go, shed one tear upon my heather-bloom,\\n\"And it shall comfort me within the tomb.\\n\\nXXXIX.\\n\"I am a shadow now, alas! alas!\\n\"Upon the skirts of human-nature dwelling\\n\"Alone: I chant alone the holy mass,\\n\"While little sounds of life are round me knelling,\\n\"And glossy bees at noon do fieldward pass,\\n\"And many a chapel bell the hour is telling,\\n\"Paining me through: those sounds grow strange to me,\\n\"And thou art distant in Humanity.\\n\\nXL.\\n\"I know what was, I feel full well what is,\\n\"And I should rage, if spirits could go mad;\\n\"Though I forget the taste of earthly bliss,\\n\"That paleness warms my grave, as though I had\\n\"A Seraph chosen from the bright abyss\\n\"To be my spouse: thy paleness makes me glad;\\n\"Thy beauty grows upon me, and I feel\\n\"A greater love through all my essence steal.\"\\n\\nXLI.\\nThe Spirit mourn\\'d \"Adieu!\"—dissolv\\'d, and left\\nThe atom darkness in a slow turmoil;\\nAs when of healthful midnight sleep bereft,\\nThinking on rugged hours and fruitless toil,\\nWe put our eyes into a pillowy cleft,\\nAnd see the spangly gloom froth up and boil:\\nIt made sad Isabella\\'s eyelids ache,\\nAnd in the dawn she started up awake;\\n\\nXLII.\\n\"Ha! ha!\" said she, \"I knew not this hard life,\\n\"I thought the worst was simple misery;\\n\"I thought some Fate with pleasure or with strife\\n\"Portion\\'d us—happy days, or else to die;\\n\"But there is crime—a brother\\'s bloody knife!\\n\"Sweet Spirit, thou hast school\\'d my infancy:\\n\"I\\'ll visit thee for this, and kiss thine eyes,\\n\"And greet thee morn and even in the skies.\"\\n\\nXLIII.\\nWhen the full morning came, she had devised\\nHow she might secret to the forest hie;\\nHow she might find the clay, so dearly prized,\\nAnd sing to it one latest lullaby;\\nHow her short absence might be unsurmised,\\nWhile she the inmost of the dream would try.\\nResolv\\'d, she took with her an aged nurse,\\nAnd went into that dismal forest-hearse.\\n\\nXLIV.\\nSee, as they creep along the river side,\\nHow she doth whisper to that aged Dame,\\nAnd, after looking round the champaign wide,\\nShows her a knife.—\"What feverous hectic flame\\n\"Burns in thee, child?—What good can thee betide,\\n\"That thou should\\'st smile again?\"—The evening came,\\nAnd they had found Lorenzo\\'s earthy bed;\\nThe flint was there, the berries at his head.\\n\\nXLV.\\nWho hath not loiter\\'d in a green church-yard,\\nAnd let his spirit, like a demon-mole,\\nWork through the clayey soil and gravel hard,\\nTo see skull, coffin\\'d bones, and funeral stole;\\nPitying each form that hungry Death hath marr\\'d,\\nAnd filling it once more with human soul?\\nAh! this is holiday to what was felt\\nWhen Isabella by Lorenzo knelt.\\n\\nXLVI.\\nShe gaz\\'d into the fresh-thrown mould, as though\\nOne glance did fully all its secrets tell;\\nClearly she saw, as other eyes would know\\nPale limbs at bottom of a crystal well;\\nUpon the murderous spot she seem\\'d to grow,\\nLike to a native lily of the dell:\\nThen with her knife, all sudden, she began\\nTo dig more fervently than misers can.\\n\\nXLVII.\\nSoon she turn\\'d up a soiled glove, whereon\\nHer silk had play\\'d in purple phantasies,\\nShe kiss\\'d it with a lip more chill than stone,\\nAnd put it in her bosom, where it dries\\nAnd freezes utterly unto the bone\\nThose dainties made to still an infant\\'s cries:\\nThen \\'gan she work again; nor stay\\'d her care,\\nBut to throw back at times her veiling hair.\\n\\nXLVIII.\\nThat old nurse stood beside her wondering,\\nUntil her heart felt pity to the core\\nAt sight of such a dismal labouring,\\nAnd so she kneeled, with her locks all hoar,\\nAnd put her lean hands to the horrid thing:\\nThree hours they labour\\'d at this travail sore;\\nAt last they felt the kernel of the grave,\\nAnd Isabella did not stamp and rave.\\n\\nXLIX.\\nAh! wherefore all this wormy circumstance?\\nWhy linger at the yawning tomb so long?\\nO for the gentleness of old Romance,\\nThe simple plaining of a minstrel\\'s song!\\nFair reader, at the old tale take a glance,\\nFor here, in truth, it doth not well belong\\nTo speak:—O turn thee to the very tale,\\nAnd taste the music of that vision pale.\\n\\nL.\\nWith duller steel than the Persèan sword\\nThey cut away no formless monster\\'s head,\\nBut one, whose gentleness did well accord\\nWith death, as life. The ancient harps have said,\\nLove never dies, but lives, immortal Lord:\\nIf Love impersonate was ever dead,\\nPale Isabella kiss\\'d it, and low moan\\'d.\\n\\'Twas love; cold,—dead indeed, but not dethroned.\\n\\nLI.\\nIn anxious secrecy they took it home,\\nAnd then the prize was all for Isabel:\\nShe calm\\'d its wild hair with a golden comb,\\nAnd all around each eye\\'s sepulchral cell\\nPointed each fringed lash; the smeared loam\\nWith tears, as chilly as a dripping well,\\nShe drench\\'d away:—and still she comb\\'d, and kept\\nSighing all day—and still she kiss\\'d, and wept.\\n\\nLII.\\nThen in a silken scarf,—sweet with the dews\\nOf precious flowers pluck\\'d in Araby,\\nAnd divine liquids come with odorous ooze\\nThrough the cold serpent pipe refreshfully,—\\nShe wrapp\\'d it up; and for its tomb did choose\\nA garden-pot, wherein she laid it by,\\nAnd cover\\'d it with mould, and o\\'er it set\\nSweet Basil, which her tears kept ever wet.\\n\\nLIII.\\nAnd she forgot the stars, the moon, and sun,\\nAnd she forgot the blue above the trees,\\nAnd she forgot the dells where waters run,\\nAnd she forgot the chilly autumn breeze;\\nShe had no knowledge when the day was done,\\nAnd the new morn she saw not: but in peace\\nHung over her sweet Basil evermore,\\nAnd moisten\\'d it with tears unto the core.\\n\\nLIV.\\nAnd so she ever fed it with thin tears,\\nWhence thick, and green, and beautiful it grew,\\nSo that it smelt more balmy than its peers\\nOf Basil-tufts in Florence; for it drew\\nNurture besides, and life, from human fears,\\nFrom the fast mouldering head there shut from view:\\nSo that the jewel, safely casketed,\\nCame forth, and in perfumed leafits spread.\\n\\nLV.\\nO Melancholy, linger here awhile!\\nO Music, Music, breathe despondingly!\\nO Echo, Echo, from some sombre isle,\\nUnknown, Lethean, sigh to us—O sigh!\\nSpirits in grief, lift up your heads, and smile;\\nLift up your heads, sweet Spirits, heavily,\\nAnd make a pale light in your cypress glooms,\\nTinting with silver wan your marble tombs.\\n\\nLVI.\\nMoan hither, all ye syllables of woe,\\nFrom the deep throat of sad Melpomene!\\nThrough bronzed lyre in tragic order go,\\nAnd touch the strings into a mystery;\\nSound mournfully upon the winds and low;\\nFor simple Isabel is soon to be\\nAmong the dead: She withers, like a palm\\nCut by an Indian for its juicy balm.\\n\\nLVII.\\nO leave the palm to wither by itself;\\nLet not quick Winter chill its dying hour!—\\nIt may not be—those Baalites of pelf,\\nHer brethren, noted the continual shower\\nFrom her dead eyes; and many a curious elf,\\nAmong her kindred, wonder\\'d that such dower\\nOf youth and beauty should be thrown aside\\nBy one mark\\'d out to be a Noble\\'s bride.\\n\\nLVIII.\\nAnd, furthermore, her brethren wonder\\'d much\\nWhy she sat drooping by the Basil green,\\nAnd why it flourish\\'d, as by magic touch;\\nGreatly they wonder\\'d what the thing might mean:\\nThey could not surely give belief, that such\\nA very nothing would have power to wean\\nHer from her own fair youth, and pleasures gay,\\nAnd even remembrance of her love\\'s delay.\\n\\nLIX.\\nTherefore they watch\\'d a time when they might sift\\nThis hidden whim; and long they watch\\'d in vain;\\nFor seldom did she go to chapel-shrift,\\nAnd seldom felt she any hunger-pain;\\nAnd when she left, she hurried back, as swift\\nAs bird on wing to breast its eggs again;\\nAnd, patient as a hen-bird, sat her there\\nBeside her Basil, weeping through her hair.\\n\\nLX.\\nYet they contriv\\'d to steal the Basil-pot,\\nAnd to examine it in secret place:\\nThe thing was vile with green and livid spot,\\nAnd yet they knew it was Lorenzo\\'s face:\\nThe guerdon of their murder they had got,\\nAnd so left Florence in a moment\\'s space,\\nNever to turn again.—Away they went,\\nWith blood upon their heads, to banishment.\\n\\nLXI.\\nO Melancholy, turn thine eyes away!\\nO Music, Music, breathe despondingly!\\nO Echo, Echo, on some other day,\\nFrom isles Lethean, sigh to us—O sigh!\\nSpirits of grief, sing not your \"Well-a-way!\"\\nFor Isabel, sweet Isabel, will die;\\nWill die a death too lone and incomplete,\\nNow they have ta\\'en away her Basil sweet.\\n\\nLXII.\\nPiteous she look\\'d on dead and senseless things,\\nAsking for her lost Basil amorously:\\nAnd with melodious chuckle in the strings\\nOf her lorn voice, she oftentimes would cry\\nAfter the Pilgrim in his wanderings,\\nTo ask him where her Basil was; and why\\n\\'Twas hid from her: \"For cruel \\'tis,\" said she,\\n\"To steal my Basil-pot away from me.\"\\n\\nLXIII.\\nAnd so she pined, and so she died forlorn,\\nImploring for her Basil to the last.\\nNo heart was there in Florence but did mourn\\nIn pity of her love, so overcast.\\nAnd a sad ditty of this story born\\nFrom mouth to mouth through all the country pass\\'d:\\nStill is the burthen sung—\"O cruelty,\\n\"To steal my Basil-pot away from me!\"(stanza XXIV): Leigh Hunt cites the \"exquisite metaphor\" of lines 3 and 4 as an instance in which Keats \"over-informs the occasion or the speaker.\" But I doubt whether it is fair to class this kind of \"over-informing\" as an error. If poeple of this kind are to be denied one element of poetry, they must be denied another; and it is scarcely more strange to find the vile brethren of Isabella talking in metaphor than to find them talking in rhyme and metre. For the rest, a common-place Italian, even a villainous Italian, feels so intensely the sunlight of his land, that we need not object to the metaphor even on dramatic grounds.\\n\\n(stanza XXXIII): For Hinnom\\'s Vale see Second Book of Chronicles of the Kings of Israel, Chapter XXVIII, verse 3: \"Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of the heathen whom the Lord had cast out before the children of Israel.\"\\n\\n(stanza XLVII): The sixth line has been a topic of censure; but I think wrongly. Taken in itself apart from the poem, it might be held to be an inopportune description; but in the context of this most tragic and pathetic story, it has to me a surpassing fitness -- a fitness astonishing in the work of a youth of Keats\\'s age in 1818. The idea of maternity thus connected as it were by chance with the image of this widowed girl on the borders of insanity emphasizes in the most beautiful way the helpless misery of a life wrecked by the wickedness of others, and throws into ghastly contrast the joy of what should have been and the agony of what was.\\n\\n(stanza XLVIII): Hunt observes here - \"It is curious to see how the simple pathos of Boccaccio, or (which is the same thing) the simple intensity of the heroine\\'s feelings, suffices our author more and more, as he gets to the end of his story. And he has related it as happily, as if he had never written any poetry but that of the heart.\"\\n\\n(stanza LIV): Whether the \"savage and tartarly\" assailants of Keats\\'s day availed themselves of the word \"leafits\" in the 8th line for an accusation of word-coining, I do not know; but as far as I have been able to ascertain this diminutive of \"leaf\" is peculiar to the present passage. \\n\\n(stanza LXII): Hunt says - \"The passage about the tone of her voice, -- the poor lost-witted coaxing, -- the \\'chuckle,\\' in which she asks after her Pilgrim and her Basil,-- is as true and touching an instance of the effect of a happy familiar word, as any in all poetry.\" It is difficult to imagine that these sentences of Hunt\\'s were not somehow misprinted; but, as the review occurs only in the original issue of The Indicator, one has no means of testing this passage by comparison with later editions. It can hardly be supposed that Hunt really thought the Pilgrim meant Lorenzo; and it ought not to be necessary to explain that the poor lost girl called after any pilgrim whom chance sent her way, enquiring of him where her Basil was.\\n\\n~ Poetical Works of John Keats, ed.
