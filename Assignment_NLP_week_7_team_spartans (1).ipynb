to miss mitford corresp vol pg 72 says of keats the death of his brother wounded him deeply and it appeared to me from that hour he began to droop he wrote his exquisite ode to the nightingale at this time and as we were one evening walking in the kilburn meadows he repeated it to me before he put it to paper in low tremulous undertone which affected me extremely lord houghton says the ode was suggested by the continued song of nightingale which in the spring of 1819 had built its nest close to wentworth place keats says his lordship aldine ed 1876 pg 237 took great pleasure in her song and one morning took his chair from the breakfast table to the grass plot under plum tree where he remained between two and three hours he then reached the house with some scraps of paper in his hand

dryads and the fauns from rushes green and brakes and cowslip lawns the ever smitten hermes empty left his golden throne bent warm on amorous theft from high olympus had he stolen light on this side of jove clouds to escape the sight of his great summoner and made retreat into forest on the shores of crete for somewhere in that sacred island dwelt nymph to whom all hoofed satyrs knelt at whose white feet the languid tritons poured pearls while on land they wither’d and adored fast by the springs where she to bathe was will not and in those meads where sometime she might haunt were strewn rich gifts unknown to any muse though fancy’s casket were unlock’d to choose ah what world of love was at her feet so hermes thought and celestial heat burnt from his winged heels to either ear that from whiteness as the lily clear blush’d into roses ’mid his golden hair fallen in jealous curls about his shoulders bare from vale to vale from wood to wood he flew breathing upon the flowers his passion new and wound with many river to its head to find where this sweet nymph prepar’d her secret bed in vain the sweet nymph might nowhere be found and so he rested on the lonely ground pensive and full of painful jealousies of the wood gods and even the very trees there as he stood he heard mournful voice such as once heard in gentle heart destroys all pain but pity thus the lone voice spake “when from this wreathed tomb shall awake “when move in sweet body fit for life “and love and pleasure and the ruddy strife “of hearts and lips ah miserable me the god dove footed glided silently round bush and tree soft brushing in his speed the taller grasses and full flowering weed until he found palpitating snake bright and cirque couchant in dusky brake she was gordian shape of dazzling hue vermilion spotted golden green and blue striped like zebra freckled like pard eyed like peacock and all crimson barr’d and full of silver moons that as she breathed dissolv’d or brighter shone or interwreathed their lustres with the gloomier tapestries— so rainbow sided touch’d with miseries she seem’d at once some penanced lady elf some demon’s mistress or the demon’s self upon her crest she wore wannish fire sprinkled with stars like ariadne’s tiar her head was serpent but ah bitter sweet she had woman’s mouth with all its pearls complete and for her eyes what could such eyes do there but weep and weep that they were born so fair as proserpine still weeps for her sicilian air her throat was serpent but the words she spake came as through bubbling honey for love’s sake and thus while hermes on his pinions lay like stoop’d falcon ere he takes his prey “fair hermes crown’d with feathers fluttering light “i had splendid dream of thee last night “i saw thee sitting on throne of gold “among the gods upon olympus old “the only sad one for thou didst not hear “the soft lute finger’d muses chaunting clear “nor even apollo when he sang alone “deaf to his throbbing throat’s long long melodious moan “i dreamt saw thee robed in purple flakes “break amorous through the clouds as morning breaks “and swiftly as bright phoebean dart “strike for the cretan isle and here thou art “too gentle hermes hast thou found the maid whereat the star of lethe not delay’d his rosy eloquence and thus inquired “thou smooth lipp’d serpent surely high inspired “thou beauteous wreath with melancholy eyes “possess whatever bliss thou canst devise “telling me only where my nymph is fled “where she doth breathe “bright planet thou hast said return’d the snake “but seal with oaths fair god “i swear said hermes “by my serpent rod “and by thine eyes and by thy starry crown light flew his earnest words among the blossoms blown then thus again the brilliance feminine “too frail of heart for this lost nymph of thine “free as the air invisibly she strays “about these thornless wilds her pleasant days “she tastes unseen unseen her nimble feet “leave traces in the grass and flowers sweet “from weary tendrils and bow’d branches green “she plucks the fruit unseen she bathes unseen “and by my power is her beauty veil’d “to keep it unaffronted unassail’d “by the love glances of unlovely eyes “of satyrs fauns and blear’d silenus’ sighs “pale grew her immortality for woe “of all these lovers and she grieved so “i took compassion on her bade her steep “her hair in weird syrops that would keep “her loveliness invisible yet free “to wander as she loves in liberty “thou shalt behold her hermes thou alone “if thou wilt as thou swearest grant my boon then once again the charmed god began an oath and through the serpent’s ears it ran warm tremulous devout psalterian ravish’d she lifted her circean head blush’d live damask and swift lisping said “i was woman let me have once more “a woman’s shape and charming as before “i love youth of corinth—o the bliss “give me my woman’s form and place me where he is “stoop hermes let me breathe upon thy brow “and thou shalt see thy sweet nymph even now the god on half shut feathers sank serene she breath’d upon his eyes and swift was seen of both the guarded nymph near smiling on the green it was no dream or say dream it was real are the dreams of gods and smoothly pass their pleasures in long immortal dream one warm flush’d moment hovering it might seem dash’d by the wood nymph’s beauty so he burn’d then lighting on the printless verdure turn’d to the swoon’d serpent and with languid arm delicate put to proof the lythe caducean charm so done upon the nymph his eyes he bent full of adoring tears and blandishment and towards her stept she like moon in wane faded before him cower’d nor could restrain her fearful sobs self folding like flower that faints into itself at evening hour but the god fostering her chilled hand she felt the warmth her eyelids open’d bland and like new flowers at morning song of bees bloom’d and gave up her honey to the lees into the green recessed woods they flew nor grew they pale as mortal lovers do left to herself the serpent now began to change her elfin blood in madness ran her mouth foam’d and the grass therewith besprent wither’d at dew so sweet and virulent her eyes in torture fix’d and anguish drear hot glaz’d and wide with lid lashes all sear flash’d phosphor and sharp sparks without one cooling tear the colours all inflam’d throughout her train she writh’d about convuls’d with scarlet pain deep volcanian yellow took the place of all her milder mooned body’s grace and as the lava ravishes the mead spoilt all her silver mail and golden brede made gloom of all her frecklings streaks and bars eclips’d her crescents and lick’d up her stars so that in moments few she was undrest of all her sapphires greens and amethyst and rubious argent of all these bereft nothing but pain and ugliness were left still shone her crown that vanish’d also she melted and disappear’d as suddenly and in the air her new voice luting soft cried “lycius gentle lycius ”—borne aloft with the bright mists about the mountains hoar these words dissolv’d crete’s forests heard no more whither fled lamia now lady bright full born beauty new and exquisite she fled into that valley they pass over who go to corinth from cenchreas’ shore and rested at the foot of those wild hills the rugged founts of the peraean rills and of that other ridge whose barren back stretches with all its mist and cloudy rack south westward to cleone there she stood about young bird’s flutter from wood fair on sloping green of mossy tread by clear pool wherein she passioned to see herself escap’d from so sore ills while her robes flaunted with the daffodils ah happy lycius —for she was maid more beautiful than ever twisted braid or sigh’d or blush’d or on spring flowered lea spread green kirtle to the minstrelsy virgin purest lipp’d yet in the lore of love deep learned to the red heart’s core not one hour old yet of sciential brain to unperplex bliss from its neighbour pain

college she had spent sweet days lovely graduate still unshent and kept his rosy terms in idle languishment why this fair creature chose so fairily by the wayside to linger we shall see but first it is fit to tell how she could muse and dream when in the serpent prison house of all she list strange or magnificent how ever where she will’d her spirit went whether to faint elysium or where down through tress lifting waves the nereids fair wind into thetis’ bower by many pearly stair or where god bacchus drains his cups divine stretch’d out at ease beneath glutinous pine or where in pluto’s gardens palatine mulciber’s columns gleam in far piazzian line and sometimes into cities she would send her dream with feast and rioting to blend and once while among mortals dreaming thus she saw the young corinthian lycius charioting foremost in the envious race like young jove with calm uneager face and fell into swooning love of him now on the moth time of that evening dim he would return that way as well she knew to corinth from the shore for freshly blew the eastern soft wind and his galley now grated the quaystones with her brazen prow in port cenchreas from egina isle fresh anchor’d whither he had been awhile to sacrifice to jove whose temple there waits with high marble doors for blood and incense rare jove heard his vows and better’d his desire for by some freakful chance he made retire from his companions and set forth to walk perhaps grown wearied of their corinth talk over the solitary hills he fared thoughtless at first but ere eve’s star appeared his phantasy was lost where reason fades in the calm’d twilight of platonic shades lamia beheld him coming near more near— close to her passing in indifference drear his silent sandals swept the mossy green so neighbour’d to him and yet so unseen she stood he pass’d shut up in mysteries his mind wrapp’d like his mantle while her eyes follow’d his steps and her neck regal white turn’d—syllabling thus “ah lycius bright “and will you leave me on the hills alone “lycius look back and be some pity shown he did not with cold wonder fearingly but orpheus like at an eurydice for so delicious were the words she sung it seem’d he had lov’d them whole summer long and soon his eyes had drunk her beauty up leaving no drop in the bewildering cup and still the cup was full —while he afraid lest she should vanish ere his lip had paid due adoration thus began to adore her soft look growing coy she saw his chain so sure “leave thee alone look back ah goddess see “whether my eyes can ever turn from thee “for pity do not this sad heart belie— “even as thou vanishest so shall die “stay though naiad of the rivers stay “to thy far wishes will thy streams obey “stay though the greenest woods be thy domain “alone they can drink up the morning rain “though descended pleiad will not one “of thine harmonious sisters keep in tune “thy spheres and as thy silver proxy shine “so sweetly to these ravish’d ears of mine “came thy sweet greeting that if thou shouldst fade “thy memory will waste me to shade “for pity do not melt ”—“if should stay said lamia “here upon this floor of clay “and pain my steps upon these flowers too rough “what canst thou say or do of charm enough “to dull the nice remembrance of my home “thou canst not ask me with thee here to roam “over these hills and vales where no joy is “empty of immortality and bliss “thou art scholar lycius and must know “that finer spirits cannot breathe below “in human climes and live alas poor youth “what taste of purer air hast thou to soothe “my essence what serener palaces “where may all my many senses please “and by mysterious sleights hundred thirsts appease “it cannot be—adieu so said she rose tiptoe with white arms spread he sick to lose the amorous promise of her lone complain swoon’d murmuring of love and pale with pain the cruel lady without any show of sorrow for her tender favourite’s woe but rather if her eyes could brighter be with brighter eyes and slow amenity put her new lips to his and gave afresh the life she had so tangled in her mesh and as he from one trance was wakening into another she began to sing happy in beauty life and love and every thing song of love too sweet for earthly lyres while like held breath the stars drew in their panting fires and then she whisper’d in such trembling tone as those who safe together met alone for the first time through many anguish’d days use other speech than looks bidding him raise his drooping head and clear his soul of doubt for that she was woman and without any more subtle fluid in her veins than throbbing blood and that the self same pains inhabited her frail strung heart as his and next she wonder’d how his eyes could miss her face so long in corinth where she said she dwelt but half retir’d and there had led days happy as the gold coin could invent without the aid of love yet in content till she saw him as once she pass’d him by where ’gainst column he leant thoughtfully at venus’ temple porch ’mid baskets heap’d of amorous herbs and flowers newly reap’d late on that eve as it was the night before the adonian feast whereof she saw no more but wept alone those days for why should she adore lycius from death awoke into amaze to see her still and singing so sweet lays then from amaze into delight he fell to hear her whisper woman’s lore so well and every word she spake entic’d him on to unperplex’d delight and pleasure known let the mad poets say whate’er they please of the sweets of fairies peris goddesses there is not such treat among them all haunters of cavern lake and waterfall as real woman lineal indeed from pyrrha’s pebbles or old adam’s seed thus gentle lamia judg’d and judg’d aright that lycius could not love in half fright so threw the goddess off and won his heart more pleasantly by playing woman’s part with no more awe than what her beauty gave that while it smote still guaranteed to save lycius to all made eloquent reply marrying to every word twinborn sigh and last pointing to corinth ask’d her sweet if it was too far that night for her soft feet the way was short for lamia’s eagerness made by spell the triple league decrease to few paces not at all surmised by blinded lycius so in her comprized they pass’d the city gates he knew not how so noiseless and he never thought to know as men talk in dream so corinth all throughout her palaces imperial and all her populous streets and temples lewd mutter’d like tempest in the distance brew’d to the wide spreaded night above her towers men women rich and poor in the cool hours shuffled their sandals over the pavement white companion’d or alone while many light flared here and there from wealthy festivals and threw their moving shadows on the walls or found them cluster’d in the corniced shade of some arch’d temple door or dusky colonnade muffling his face of greeting friends in fear her fingers he press’d hard as one came near with curl’d gray beard sharp eyes and smooth bald crown slow stepp’d and robed in philosophic gown lycius shrank closer as they met and past into his mantle adding wings to haste while hurried lamia trembled “ah said he “why do you shudder love so ruefully “why does your tender palm dissolve in dew ”— “i am wearied said fair lamia “tell me who “is that old man cannot bring to mind “his features —lycius

Lord Houghton says of this stage --\\r\\n\"The pedestrians passed by Solway Frith through that delightful part of Kirkcudbrightshire, the scene of \\'Guy Mannering.\\' Keats had never read the novel, but was much struck with the character of Meg Merrilies as delineated to him by Brown. He seemed at once to realise the creation of the novelist, and, suddenly stopping in the pathway, at a point where a profusion of honeysuckles, wild rose, and fox-glove, mingled with the bramble and broom that filled up the spaces between the shattered rocks, he cried out, \\'Without a shadow of a doubt on that spot has old Meg Merrilies often boiled her kettle.\\'\"\\r\\nOn the 3rd of July he writes to Tom from \"Auchtercairn\" (meaning, I presume, Auchencairn, some six miles east of Kirkcudbright) -- \"We are now in Meg Merrilies\\' country, and have, this morning, passed through some parts exactly suited to her. Kirkcudbright County is very beautiful, very wild, with craggy hills, somewhat in the Westmoreland fashion.  We have come down from Dumfries to the sea-coast part of it. The following song you will have from Dilke, but perhaps you would like it here.\"\\r\\nI should judge that the scene given by Brown to Lord Houghton belonged rather to the morning of the 3rd than to the evening of the 2nd; and that Keats took out his current letter to his sister at Auchencairn on pausing there to breakfast, and wrote the poem into it when he began a fresh letter to Tom with it. Thus, besides a rough draft, there would be three fair copies of the poem, one for Tom, one for Fanny, and one for Mr. Dilke.\\'\\r\\n~ Poetical Works of John Keats, ed. H.

Part I ', 'Poem': 'upon time before the faery broods drove nymph and satyr from the prosperous woods before king oberon bright diadem sceptre and mantle clasp with dewy gem frighted away the dryads and the fauns from rushes green and brakes and cowslip lawns the ever smitten hermes empty left his golden throne bent warm on amorous theft from high olympus had he stolen light on this side of jove clouds to escape the sight of his great summoner and made retreat into forest on the shores of crete for somewhere in that sacred island dwelt nymph to whom all hoofed satyrs knelt at whose white feet the languid tritons poured pearls while on land they wither’d and adored fast by the springs where she to bathe was will not and in those meads where sometime she might haunt were strewn rich gifts unknown to any muse though fancy’s casket were unlock’d to choose ah what world of love was at her feet so hermes thought and celestial heat burnt from his winged heels to either ear that from whiteness as the lily clear blush’d into roses ’mid his golden hair fallen in jealous curls about his shoulders bare from vale to vale from wood to wood he flew breathing upon the flowers his passion new and wound with many river to its head to find where this sweet nymph prepar’d her secret bed in vain the sweet nymph might nowhere be found and so he rested on the lonely ground pensive and full of painful jealousies of the wood gods and even the very trees there as he stood he heard mournful voice such as once heard in gentle heart destroys all pain but pity thus the lone voice spake “when from this wreathed tomb shall awake “when move in sweet body fit for life “and love and pleasure and the ruddy strife “of hearts and lips ah miserable me the god dove footed glided silently round bush and tree soft brushing in his speed the taller grasses and full flowering weed until he found palpitating snake bright and cirque couchant in dusky brake she was gordian shape of dazzling hue vermilion spotted golden green and blue striped like zebra freckled like pard eyed like peacock and all crimson barr’d and full of silver moons that as she breathed dissolv’d or brighter shone or interwreathed their lustres with the gloomier tapestries— so rainbow sided touch’d with miseries she seem’d at once some penanced lady elf some demon’s mistress or the demon’s self upon her crest she wore wannish fire sprinkled with stars like ariadne’s tiar her head was serpent but ah bitter sweet she had woman’s mouth with all its pearls complete and for her eyes what could such eyes do there but weep and weep that they were born so fair as proserpine still weeps for her sicilian air her throat was serpent but the words she spake came as through bubbling honey for love’s sake and thus while hermes on his pinions lay like stoop’d falcon ere he takes his prey “fair hermes crown’d with feathers fluttering light “i had splendid dream of thee last night “i saw thee sitting on throne of gold “among the gods upon olympus old “the only sad one for thou didst not hear “the soft lute finger’d muses chaunting clear “nor even apollo when he sang alone “deaf to his throbbing throat’s long long melodious moan “i dreamt saw thee robed in purple flakes “break amorous through the clouds as morning breaks “and swiftly as bright phoebean dart “strike for the cretan isle and here thou art “too gentle hermes hast thou found the maid whereat the star of lethe not delay’d his rosy eloquence and thus inquired “thou smooth lipp’d serpent surely high inspired “thou beauteous wreath with melancholy eyes “possess whatever bliss thou canst devise “telling me only where my nymph is fled “where she doth breathe “bright planet thou hast said return’d the snake “but seal with oaths fair god “i swear said hermes “by my serpent rod “and by thine eyes and by thy starry crown light flew his earnest words among the blossoms blown then thus again the brilliance feminine “too frail of heart for this lost nymph of thine “free as the air invisibly she strays “about these thornless wilds her pleasant days “she tastes unseen unseen her nimble feet “leave traces in the grass and flowers sweet “from weary tendrils and bow’d branches green “she plucks the fruit unseen she bathes unseen “and by my power is her beauty veil’d “to keep it unaffronted unassail’d “by the love glances of unlovely eyes “of satyrs fauns and blear’d silenus’ sighs “pale grew her immortality for woe “of all these lovers and she grieved so “i took compassion on her bade her steep “her hair in weird syrops that would keep “her loveliness invisible yet free “to wander as she loves in liberty “thou shalt behold her hermes thou alone “if thou wilt as thou swearest grant my boon then once again the charmed god began an oath and through the serpent’s ears it ran warm tremulous devout psalterian ravish’d she lifted her circean head blush’d live damask and swift lisping said “i was woman let me have once more “a woman’s shape and charming as before “i love youth of corinth—o the bliss “give me my woman’s form and place me where he is “stoop hermes let me breathe upon thy brow “and thou shalt see thy sweet nymph even now the god on half shut feathers sank serene she breath’d upon his eyes and swift was seen of both the guarded nymph near smiling on the green it was no dream or say dream it was real are the dreams of gods and smoothly pass their pleasures in long immortal dream one warm flush’d moment hovering it might seem dash’d by the wood nymph’s beauty so he burn’d then lighting on the printless verdure turn’d to the swoon’d serpent and with languid arm delicate put to proof the lythe caducean charm so done upon the nymph his eyes he bent full of adoring tears and blandishment and towards her stept she like moon in wane faded before him cower’d nor could restrain her fearful sobs self folding like flower that faints into itself at evening hour but the god fostering her chilled hand she felt the warmth her eyelids open’d bland and like new flowers at morning song of bees bloom’d and gave up her honey to the lees into the green recessed woods they flew nor grew they pale as mortal lovers do left to herself the serpent now began to change her elfin blood in madness ran her mouth foam’d and the grass therewith besprent wither’d at dew so sweet and virulent her eyes in torture fix’d and anguish drear hot glaz’d and wide with lid lashes all sear flash’d phosphor and sharp sparks without one cooling tear the colours all inflam’d throughout her train she writh’d about convuls’d with scarlet pain deep volcanian yellow took the place of all her milder mooned body’s grace and as the lava ravishes the mead spoilt all her silver mail and golden brede made gloom of all her frecklings streaks and bars eclips’d her crescents and lick’d up her stars so that in moments few she was undrest of all her sapphires greens and amethyst and rubious argent of all these bereft nothing but pain and ugliness were left still shone her crown that vanish’d also she melted and disappear’d as suddenly and in the air her new voice luting soft cried “lycius gentle lycius ”—borne aloft with the bright mists about the mountains hoar these words dissolv’d crete’s forests heard no more whither fled lamia now lady bright full born beauty new and exquisite she fled into that valley they pass over who go to corinth from cenchreas’ shore and rested at the foot of those wild hills the rugged founts of the peraean rills and of that other ridge whose barren back stretches with all its mist and cloudy rack south westward to cleone there she stood about young bird’s flutter from wood fair on sloping green of mossy tread by clear pool wherein she passioned to see herself escap’d from so sore ills while her robes flaunted with the daffodils ah happy lycius —for she was maid more beautiful than ever twisted braid or sigh’d or blush’d or on spring flowered lea spread green kirtle to the minstrelsy virgin purest lipp’d yet in the lore of love deep learned to the red heart’s core not one hour old yet of sciential brain to unperplex bliss from its neighbour pain define their pettish limits and estrange their points of contact and swift counterchange intrigue with the specious chaos and dispart its most ambiguous atoms with sure art as though in cupid’s college she had spent sweet days lovely graduate still unshent and kept his rosy terms in idle languishment why this fair creature chose so fairily by the wayside to linger we shall see but first it is fit to tell how she could muse and dream when in the serpent prison house of all she list strange or magnificent how ever where she will’d her spirit went whether to faint elysium or where down through tress lifting waves the nereids fair wind into thetis’ bower by many pearly stair or where god bacchus drains his cups divine stretch’d out at ease beneath glutinous pine or where in pluto’s gardens palatine mulciber’s columns gleam in far piazzian line and sometimes into cities she would send her dream with feast and rioting to blend and once while among mortals dreaming thus she saw the young corinthian lycius charioting foremost in the envious race like young jove with calm uneager face and fell into swooning love of him now on the moth time of that evening dim he would return that way as well she knew to corinth from the shore for freshly blew the eastern soft wind and his galley now grated the quaystones with her brazen prow in port cenchreas from egina isle fresh anchor’d whither he had been awhile to sacrifice to jove whose temple there waits with high marble doors for blood and incense rare jove heard his vows and better’d his desire for by some freakful chance he made retire from his companions and set forth to walk perhaps grown wearied of their corinth talk over the solitary hills he fared thoughtless at first but ere eve’s star appeared his phantasy was lost where reason fades in the calm’d twilight of platonic shades lamia beheld him coming near more near— close to her passing in indifference drear his silent sandals swept the mossy green so neighbour’d to him and yet so unseen she stood he pass’d shut up in mysteries his mind wrapp’d like his mantle while her eyes follow’d his steps and her neck regal white turn’d—syllabling thus “ah lycius bright “and will you leave me on the hills alone “lycius look back and be some pity shown he did not with cold wonder fearingly but orpheus like at an eurydice for so delicious were the words she sung it seem’d he had lov’d them whole summer long and soon his eyes had drunk her beauty up leaving no drop in the bewildering cup and still the cup was full —while he afraid lest she should vanish ere his lip had paid due adoration thus began to adore her soft look growing coy she saw his chain so sure “leave thee alone look back ah goddess see “whether my eyes can ever turn from thee “for pity do not this sad heart belie— “even as thou vanishest so shall die “stay though naiad of the rivers stay “to thy far wishes will thy streams obey “stay though the greenest woods be thy domain “alone they can drink up the morning rain “though descended pleiad will not one “of thine harmonious sisters keep in tune “thy spheres and as thy silver proxy shine “so sweetly to these ravish’d ears of mine “came thy sweet greeting that if thou shouldst fade “thy memory will waste me to shade “for pity do not melt ”—“if should stay said lamia “here upon this floor of clay “and pain my steps upon these flowers too rough “what canst thou say or do of charm enough “to dull the nice remembrance of my home “thou canst not ask me with thee here to roam “over these hills and vales where no joy is “empty of immortality and bliss “thou art scholar lycius and must know “that finer spirits cannot breathe below “in human climes and live alas poor youth “what taste of purer air hast thou to soothe “my essence what serener palaces “where may all my many senses please “and by mysterious sleights hundred thirsts appease “it cannot be—adieu so said she rose tiptoe with white arms spread he sick to lose the amorous promise of her lone complain swoon’d murmuring of love and pale with pain the cruel lady without any show of sorrow for her tender favourite’s woe but rather if her eyes could brighter be with brighter eyes and slow amenity put her new lips to his and gave afresh the life she had so tangled in her mesh and as he from one trance was wakening into another she began to sing happy in beauty life and love and every thing song of love too sweet for earthly lyres while like held breath the stars drew in their panting fires and then she whisper’d in such trembling tone as those who safe together met alone for the first time through many anguish’d days use other speech than looks bidding him raise his drooping head and clear his soul of doubt for that she was woman and without any more subtle fluid in her veins than throbbing blood and that the self same pains inhabited her frail strung heart as his and next she wonder’d how his eyes could miss her face so long in corinth where she said she dwelt but half retir’d and there had led days happy as the gold coin could invent without the aid of love yet in content till she saw him as once she pass’d him by where ’gainst column he leant thoughtfully at venus’ temple porch ’mid baskets heap’d of amorous herbs and flowers newly reap’d late on that eve as it was the night before the adonian feast whereof she saw no more but wept alone those days for why should she adore lycius from death awoke into amaze to see her still and singing so sweet lays then from amaze into delight he fell to hear her whisper woman’s lore so well and every word she spake entic’d him on to unperplex’d delight and pleasure known let the mad poets say whate’er they please of the sweets of fairies peris goddesses there is not such treat among them all haunters of cavern lake and waterfall as real woman lineal indeed from pyrrha’s pebbles or old adam’s seed thus gentle lamia judg’d and judg’d aright that lycius could not love in half fright so threw the goddess off and won his heart more pleasantly by playing woman’s part with no more awe than what her beauty gave that while it smote still guaranteed to save lycius to all made eloquent reply marrying to every word twinborn sigh and last pointing to corinth ask’d her sweet if it was too far that night for her soft feet the way was short for lamia’s eagerness made by spell the triple league decrease to few paces not at all surmised by blinded lycius so in her comprized they pass’d the city gates he knew not how so noiseless and he never thought to know as men talk in dream so corinth all throughout her palaces imperial and all her populous streets and temples lewd mutter’d like tempest in the distance brew’d to the wide spreaded night above her towers men women rich and poor in the cool hours shuffled their sandals over the pavement white companion’d or alone while many light flared here and there from wealthy festivals and threw their moving shadows on the walls or found them cluster’d in the corniced shade of some arch’d temple door or dusky colonnade muffling his face of greeting friends in fear her fingers he press’d hard as one came near with curl’d gray beard sharp eyes and smooth bald crown slow stepp’d and robed in philosophic gown lycius shrank closer as they met and past into his mantle adding wings to haste while hurried lamia trembled “ah said he “why do you shudder love so ruefully “why does your tender palm dissolve in dew ”— “i am wearied said fair lamia “tell me who “is that old man cannot bring to mind “his features —lycius wherefore did you blind “yourself from his quick eyes lycius replied “it is apollonius sage my trusty guide “and good instructor but to night he seems “the ghost of folly haunting my sweet dreams while yet he spake they had arrived before

before the faery broods \\nDrove Nymph and Satyr from the prosperous woods, \\nBefore King Oberon\\'s bright diadem, \\nSceptre, and mantle, clasp\\'d with dewy gem, \\nFrighted away the Dryads and the Fauns\\xa0  \\nFrom rushes green, and brakes, and cowslip\\'d lawns, \\nThe ever-smitten Hermes empty left \\nHis golden throne, bent warm on amorous theft: \\nFrom high Olympus had he stolen light, \\nOn this side of Jove\\'s clouds, to escape the sight\\xa0 \\nOf his great summoner, and made retreat \\nInto a forest on the shores of Crete. \\nFor somewhere in that sacred island dwelt \\nA nymph, to whom all hoofed Satyrs knelt; \\nAt whose white feet the languid Tritons poured\\xa0 \\nPearls, while on land they wither’d and adored. \\nFast by the springs where she to bathe was wont, \\nAnd in those meads where sometime she might haunt, \\nWere strewn rich gifts, unknown to any Muse, \\nThough Fancy’s casket were unlock’d to choose.\\xa0 \\nAh, what a world of love was at her feet! \\nSo Hermes thought, and a celestial heat \\nBurnt from his winged heels to either ear, \\nThat from a whiteness, as the lily clear, \\nBlush’d into roses ’mid his golden hair,\\xa0 \\nFallen in jealous curls about his shoulders bare. \\nFrom vale to vale, from wood to wood, he flew, \\nBreathing upon the flowers his passion new, \\nAnd wound with many a river to its head, \\nTo find where this sweet nymph prepar’d her secret bed:\\xa0 \\nIn vain; the sweet nymph might nowhere be found, \\nAnd so he rested, on the lonely ground, \\nPensive, and full of painful jealousies \\nOf the Wood-Gods, and even the very trees. \\nThere as he stood, he heard a mournful voice,\\xa0 \\nSuch as once heard, in gentle heart, destroys \\nAll pain but pity: thus the lone voice spake: \\n“When from this wreathed tomb shall I awake! \\n“When move in a sweet body fit for life, \\n“And love, and pleasure, and the ruddy strife\\xa0 \\n“Of hearts and lips! Ah, miserable me!” \\nThe God, dove-footed, glided silently \\nRound bush and tree, soft-brushing, in his speed, \\nThe taller grasses and full-flowering weed, \\nUntil he found a palpitating snake,\\xa0 \\nBright, and cirque-couchant in a dusky brake. \\n\\xa0 \\n\\xa0 She was a gordian shape of dazzling hue, \\nVermilion-spotted, golden, green, and blue; \\nStriped like a zebra, freckled like a pard, \\nEyed like a peacock, and all crimson barr’d;\\xa0 \\nAnd full of silver moons, that, as she breathed, \\nDissolv’d, or brighter shone, or interwreathed \\nTheir lustres with the gloomier tapestries— \\nSo rainbow-sided, touch’d with miseries, \\nShe seem’d, at once, some penanced lady elf,\\xa0 \\nSome demon’s mistress, or the demon’s self. \\nUpon her crest she wore a wannish fire \\nSprinkled with stars, like Ariadne’s tiar: \\nHer head was serpent, but ah, bitter-sweet! \\nShe had a woman’s mouth with all its pearls complete:\\xa0 \\nAnd for her eyes: what could such eyes do there \\nBut weep, and weep, that they were born so fair? \\nAs Proserpine still weeps for her Sicilian air. \\nHer throat was serpent, but the words she spake \\nCame, as through bubbling honey, for Love’s sake,\\xa0 \\nAnd thus; while Hermes on his pinions lay, \\nLike a stoop’d falcon ere he takes his prey. \\n\\xa0 \\n\\xa0 “Fair Hermes, crown’d with feathers, fluttering light, \\n“I had a splendid dream of thee last night: \\n“I saw thee sitting, on a throne of gold,\\xa0 \\n“Among the Gods, upon Olympus old, \\n“The only sad one; for thou didst not hear \\n“The soft, lute-finger’d Muses chaunting clear, \\n“Nor even Apollo when he sang alone, \\n“Deaf to his throbbing throat’s long, long melodious moan.\\xa0 \\n“I dreamt I saw thee, robed in purple flakes, \\n“Break amorous through the clouds, as morning breaks, \\n“And, swiftly as a bright Phoebean dart, \\n“Strike for the Cretan isle; and here thou art! \\n“Too gentle Hermes, hast thou found the maid?”\\xa0 \\nWhereat the star of Lethe not delay’d \\nHis rosy eloquence, and thus inquired: \\n“Thou smooth-lipp’d serpent, surely high inspired! \\n“Thou beauteous wreath, with melancholy eyes, \\n“Possess whatever bliss thou canst devise,\\xa0 \\n“Telling me only where my nymph is fled,— \\n“Where she doth breathe!” “Bright planet, thou hast said,” \\nReturn’d the snake, “but seal with oaths, fair God!” \\n“I swear,” said Hermes, “by my serpent rod, \\n“And by thine eyes, and by thy starry crown!”\\xa0 \\nLight flew his earnest words, among the blossoms blown. \\nThen thus again the brilliance feminine: \\n“Too frail of heart! for this lost nymph of thine, \\n“Free as the air, invisibly, she strays \\n“About these thornless wilds; her pleasant days\\xa0 \\n“She tastes unseen; unseen her nimble feet \\n“Leave traces in the grass and flowers sweet; \\n“From weary tendrils, and bow’d branches green, \\n“She plucks the fruit unseen, she bathes unseen: \\n“And by my power is her beauty veil’d \\n“To keep it unaffronted, unassail’d \\n“By the love-glances of unlovely eyes, \\n“Of Satyrs, Fauns, and blear’d Silenus’ sighs. \\n“Pale grew her immortality, for woe \\n“Of all these lovers, and she grieved so \\n“I took compassion on her, bade her steep \\n“Her hair in weird syrops, that would keep \\n“Her loveliness invisible, yet free \\n“To wander as she loves, in liberty. \\n“Thou shalt behold her, Hermes, thou alone, \\n“If thou wilt, as thou swearest, grant my boon!” \\nThen, once again, the charmed God began \\nAn oath, and through the serpent’s ears it ran \\nWarm, tremulous, devout, psalterian. \\nRavish’d, she lifted her Circean head, \\nBlush’d a live damask, and swift-lisping said, \\n“I was a woman, let me have once more \\n“A woman’s shape, and charming as before. \\n“I love a youth of Corinth—O the bliss! \\n“Give me my woman’s form, and place me where he is. \\n“Stoop, Hermes, let me breathe upon thy brow, \\n“And thou shalt see thy sweet nymph even now.” \\nThe God on half-shut feathers sank serene, \\nShe breath’d upon his eyes, and swift was seen \\nOf both the guarded nymph near-smiling on the green. \\nIt was no dream; or say a dream it was, \\nReal are the dreams of Gods, and smoothly pass \\nTheir pleasures in a long immortal dream. \\nOne warm, flush’d moment, hovering, it might seem \\nDash’d by the wood-nymph’s beauty, so he burn’d; \\nThen, lighting on the printless verdure, turn’d \\nTo the swoon’d serpent, and with languid arm, \\nDelicate, put to proof the lythe Caducean charm. \\nSo done, upon the nymph his eyes he bent, \\nFull of adoring tears and blandishment, \\nAnd towards her stept: she, like a moon in wane, \\nFaded before him, cower’d, nor could restrain \\nHer fearful sobs, self-folding like a flower \\nThat faints into itself at evening hour: \\nBut the God fostering her chilled hand, \\nShe felt the warmth, her eyelids open’d bland, \\nAnd, like new flowers at morning song of bees, \\nBloom’d, and gave up her honey to the lees. \\nInto the green-recessed woods they flew; \\nNor grew they pale, as mortal lovers do. \\n\\xa0 \\n\\xa0 Left to herself, the serpent now began \\nTo change; her elfin blood in madness ran, \\nHer mouth foam’d, and the grass, therewith besprent, \\nWither’d at dew so sweet and virulent; \\nHer eyes in torture fix’d, and anguish drear, \\nHot, glaz’d, and wide, with lid-lashes all sear, \\nFlash’d phosphor and sharp sparks, without one cooling tear. \\nThe colours all inflam’d throughout her train, \\nShe writh’d about, convuls’d with scarlet pain: \\nA deep volcanian yellow took the place \\nOf all her milder-mooned body’s grace; \\nAnd, as the lava ravishes the mead, \\nSpoilt all her silver mail, and golden brede; \\nMade gloom of all her frecklings, streaks and bars, \\nEclips’d her crescents, and lick’d up her stars: \\nSo that, in moments few, she was undrest \\nOf all her sapphires, greens, and amethyst, \\nAnd rubious-argent: of all these bereft, \\nNothing but pain and ugliness were left. \\nStill shone her crown; that vanish’d, also she \\nMelted and disappear’d as suddenly; \\nAnd in the air, her new voice luting soft, \\nCried, “Lycius! gentle Lycius!”—Borne aloft \\nWith the bright mists about the mountains hoar \\nThese words dissolv’d: Crete’s forests heard no more. \\n\\xa0 \\n\\xa0 Whither fled Lamia, now a lady bright, \\nA full-born beauty new and exquisite? \\nShe fled into that valley they pass o’er \\nWho go to Corinth from Cenchreas’ shore; \\nAnd rested at the foot of those wild hills, \\nThe rugged founts of the Peraean rills, \\nAnd of that other ridge whose barren back \\nStretches, with all its mist and cloudy rack, \\nSouth-westward to Cleone. There she stood \\nAbout a young bird’s flutter from a wood, \\nFair, on a sloping green of mossy tread, \\nBy a clear pool, wherein she passioned \\nTo see herself escap’d from so sore ills, \\nWhile her robes flaunted with the daffodils. \\n\\xa0 \\n\\xa0 Ah, happy Lycius!—for she was a maid \\nMore beautiful than ever twisted braid, \\nOr sigh’d, or blush’d, or on spring-flowered lea \\nSpread a green kirtle to the minstrelsy: \\nA virgin purest lipp’d, yet in the lore \\nOf love deep learned to the red heart’s core: \\nNot one hour old, yet of sciential brain \\nTo unperplex bliss from its neighbour pain; \\nDefine their pettish limits, and estrange \\nTheir points of contact, and swift counterchange; \\nIntrigue with the specious chaos, and dispart \\nIts most ambiguous atoms with sure art; \\nAs though in Cupid’s college she had spent \\nSweet days a lovely graduate, still unshent, \\nAnd kept his rosy terms in idle languishment. \\n\\xa0 \\n\\xa0 Why this fair creature chose so fairily \\nBy the wayside to linger, we shall see; \\nBut first ’tis fit to tell how she could muse \\nAnd dream, when in the serpent prison-house, \\nOf all she list, strange or magnificent: \\nHow, ever, where she will’d, her spirit went; \\nWhether to faint Elysium, or where \\nDown through tress-lifting waves the Nereids fair \\nWind into Thetis’ bower by many a pearly stair; \\nOr where God Bacchus drains his cups divine, \\nStretch’d out, at ease, beneath a glutinous pine; \\nOr where in Pluto’s gardens palatine \\nMulciber’s columns gleam in far piazzian line. \\nAnd sometimes into cities she would send \\nHer dream, with feast and rioting to blend; \\nAnd once, while among mortals dreaming thus, \\nShe saw the young Corinthian Lycius \\nCharioting foremost in the envious race, \\nLike a young Jove with calm uneager face, \\nAnd fell into a swooning love of him. \\nNow on the moth-time of that evening dim \\nHe would return that way, as well she knew, \\nTo Corinth from the shore; for freshly blew \\nThe eastern soft wind, and his galley now \\nGrated the quaystones with her brazen prow \\nIn port Cenchreas, from Egina isle \\nFresh anchor’d; whither he had been awhile \\nTo sacrifice to Jove, whose temple there \\nWaits with high marble doors for blood and incense rare. \\nJove heard his vows, and better’d his desire; \\nFor by some freakful chance he made retire \\nFrom his companions, and set forth to walk, \\nPerhaps grown wearied of their Corinth talk: \\nOver the solitary hills he fared, \\nThoughtless at first, but ere eve’s star appeared \\nHis phantasy was lost, where reason fades, \\nIn the calm’d twilight of Platonic shades. \\nLamia beheld him coming, near, more near— \\nClose to her passing, in indifference drear, \\nHis silent sandals swept the mossy green; \\nSo neighbour’d to him, and yet so unseen \\nShe stood: he pass’d, shut up in mysteries, \\nHis mind wrapp’d like his mantle, while her eyes \\nFollow’d his steps, and her neck regal white \\nTurn’d—syllabling thus, “Ah, Lycius bright, \\n“And will you leave me on the hills alone? \\n“Lycius, look back! and be some pity shown.” \\nHe did; not with cold wonder fearingly, \\nBut Orpheus-like at an Eurydice; \\nFor so delicious were the words she sung, \\nIt seem’d he had lov’d them a whole summer long: \\nAnd soon his eyes had drunk her beauty up, \\nLeaving no drop in the bewildering cup, \\nAnd still the cup was full,—while he afraid \\nLest she should vanish ere his lip had paid \\nDue adoration, thus began to adore; \\nHer soft look growing coy, she saw his chain so sure: \\n“Leave thee alone! Look back! Ah, Goddess, see \\n“Whether my eyes can ever turn from thee! \\n“For pity do not this sad heart belie— \\n“Even as thou vanishest so I shall die. \\n“Stay! though a Naiad of the rivers, stay! \\n“To thy far wishes will thy streams obey: \\n“Stay! though the greenest woods be thy domain, \\n“Alone they can drink up the morning rain: \\n“Though a descended Pleiad, will not one \\n“Of thine harmonious sisters keep in tune \\n“Thy spheres, and as thy silver proxy shine? \\n“So sweetly to these ravish’d ears of mine \\n“Came thy sweet greeting, that if thou shouldst fade \\n“Thy memory will waste me to a shade:— \\n“For pity do not melt!”—“If I should stay,” \\nSaid Lamia, “here, upon this floor of clay, \\n“And pain my steps upon these flowers too rough, \\n“What canst thou say or do of charm enough \\n“To dull the nice remembrance of my home? \\n“Thou canst not ask me with thee here to roam \\n“Over these hills and vales, where no joy is,— \\n“Empty of immortality and bliss! \\n“Thou art a scholar, Lycius, and must know \\n“That finer spirits cannot breathe below \\n“In human climes, and live: Alas! poor youth, \\n“What taste of purer air hast thou to soothe \\n“My essence? What serener palaces, \\n“Where I may all my many senses please, \\n“And by mysterious sleights a hundred thirsts appease? \\n“It cannot be—Adieu!” So said, she rose \\nTiptoe with white arms spread. He, sick to lose \\nThe amorous promise of her lone complain, \\nSwoon’d, murmuring of love, and pale with pain. \\nThe cruel lady, without any show \\nOf sorrow for her tender favourite’s woe, \\nBut rather, if her eyes could brighter be, \\nWith brighter eyes and slow amenity, \\nPut her new lips to his, and gave afresh \\nThe life she had so tangled in her mesh: \\nAnd as he from one trance was wakening \\nInto another, she began to sing, \\nHappy in beauty, life, and love, and every thing, \\nA song of love, too sweet for earthly lyres, \\nWhile, like held breath, the stars drew in their panting fires \\nAnd then she whisper’d in such trembling tone, \\nAs those who, safe together met alone \\nFor the first time through many anguish’d days, \\nUse other speech than looks; bidding him raise \\nHis drooping head, and clear his soul of doubt, \\nFor that she was a woman, and without \\nAny more subtle fluid in her veins \\nThan throbbing blood, and that the self-same pains \\nInhabited her frail-strung heart as his. \\nAnd next she wonder’d how his eyes could miss \\nHer face so long in Corinth, where, she said, \\nShe dwelt but half retir’d, and there had led \\nDays happy as the gold coin could invent \\nWithout the aid of love; yet in content \\nTill she saw him, as once she pass’d him by, \\nWhere ’gainst a column he leant thoughtfully \\nAt Venus’ temple porch, ’mid baskets heap’d \\nOf amorous herbs and flowers, newly reap’d \\nLate on that eve, as ’twas the night before \\nThe Adonian feast; whereof she saw no more, \\nBut wept alone those days, for why should she adore? \\nLycius from death awoke into amaze, \\nTo see her still, and singing so sweet lays; \\nThen from amaze into delight he fell \\nTo hear her whisper woman’s lore so well; \\nAnd every word she spake entic’d him on \\nTo unperplex’d delight and pleasure known. \\nLet the mad poets say whate’er they please \\nOf the sweets of Fairies, Peris, Goddesses, \\nThere is not such a treat among them all, \\nHaunters of cavern, lake, and waterfall, \\nAs a real woman, lineal indeed \\nFrom Pyrrha’s pebbles or old Adam’s seed. \\nThus gentle Lamia judg’d, and judg’d aright, \\nThat Lycius could not love in half a fright, \\nSo threw the goddess off, and won his heart \\nMore pleasantly by playing woman’s part, \\nWith no more awe than what her beauty gave, \\nThat, while it smote, still guaranteed to save. \\nLycius to all made eloquent reply, \\nMarrying to every word a twinborn sigh; \\nAnd last, pointing to Corinth, ask’d her sweet, \\nIf ’twas too far that night for her soft feet. \\nThe way was short, for Lamia’s eagerness \\nMade, by a spell, the triple league decrease \\nTo a few paces; not at all surmised \\nBy blinded Lycius, so in her comprized. \\nThey pass’d the city gates, he knew not how \\nSo noiseless, and he never thought to know. \\n\\xa0 \\n\\xa0 As men talk in a dream, so Corinth all, \\nThroughout her palaces imperial, \\nAnd all her populous streets and temples lewd, \\nMutter’d, like tempest in the distance brew’d, \\nTo the wide-spreaded night above her towers. \\nMen, women, rich and poor, in the cool hours, \\nShuffled their sandals o’er the pavement white, \\nCompanion’d or alone; while many a light \\nFlared, here and there, from wealthy festivals, \\nAnd threw their moving shadows on the walls, \\nOr found them cluster’d in the corniced shade \\nOf some arch’d temple door, or dusky colonnade. \\n\\xa0 \\n\\xa0 Muffling his face, of greeting friends in fear, \\nHer fingers he press’d hard, as one came near \\nWith curl’d gray beard, sharp eyes, and smooth bald crown, \\nSlow-stepp’d, and robed in philosophic gown: \\nLycius shrank closer, as they met and past, \\nInto his mantle, adding wings to haste, \\nWhile hurried Lamia trembled: “Ah,” said he, \\n“Why do you shudder, love, so ruefully? \\n“Why does your tender palm dissolve in dew?”— \\n“I’m wearied,” said fair Lamia: “tell me who \\n“Is that old man? I cannot bring to mind \\n“His features:—Lycius! wherefore did you blind \\n“Yourself from his quick eyes?” Lycius replied, \\n“’Tis Apollonius sage, my trusty guide \\n“And good instructor; but to-night he seems \\n“The ghost of folly haunting my sweet dreams. \\n\\xa0 \\n\\xa0 While yet he spake they had arrived before \\nA pillar\\'d porch, with lofty portal door, \\nWhere hung a silver lamp, whose phosphor glow \\nReflected in the slabbed steps below, \\nMild as a star in water; for so new, \\nAnd so unsullied was the marble hue, \\nSo through the crystal polish, liquid fine, \\nRan the dark veins, that none but feet divine \\nCould e\\'er have touch\\'d there. Sounds Aeolian \\nBreath\\'d from the hinges, as the ample span \\nOf the wide doors disclos\\'d a place unknown \\nSome time to any, but those two alone, \\nAnd a few Persian mutes, who that same year \\nWere seen about the markets: none knew where \\nThey could inhabit; the most curious \\nWere foil\\'d, who watch\\'d to trace them to their house: \\nAnd but the flitter-winged verse must tell, \\nFor truth\\'s sake, what woe afterwards befel, \\n\\'Twould humour many a heart to leave them thus, \\nShut from the busy world of more incredulous.(line 48): Originally, \"Cerulean-spotted.\" Leigh Hunt says of this passage, \"The admiration, pity, and horror, to be excited by humanity in a brute shape, were never perhaps called upon by a greater mixture of beauty and deformity than in the picture of this creature. Our pity and suspicions are begged by the first word: the profuse and vital beauties with which she is covered seem proportioned to her misery and natural rights; and lest we should lose sight of them in this gorgeousness, the \\'woman\\'s mouth\\' fills us at once with shuddering and compassion.\"\\n\\n(line 158): The manuscript reads \"vulcanian,\" the first edition \"volcanian.\" It seems to me more likely that the manuscript accords with the poet\\'s intention than that printed text does, for this old orthography is the more characteristic of the vocabulary of this particular poem, as introducing the more conspicuously the mythic personal origin of the common noun \"volcano\" or \"vulcano.\"\\n\\n~ Poetical Works of John Keats, ed.

It was then that he composed that sonnet of solemn tenderness, \\'Bright star! would I were stedfast as thou art,\\' &c.and wrote it out in a copy of Shakespeare\\'s Poems he had given to Severn a few days before.  I know nothing written afterwards.\"The copy of Shakespeare\\'s Poetical Works had been given to Keats by John Hamilton Reynolds, and is now in the possession of Sir Charles Dilke [rather was in 125 years ago]. It is a royal 8vo volume \"printed for Thomas Wilson, No. 10, London-House-yard, St. Paul\\'s,\" in 1806; and this sonnet, of which a fac-simile is here given, is written upon the verso of the fly-title to A Lover\\'s Complaint.  It seems fair to assume that the reason of its being so high up on the page is that it thus faces a space of equal size containing no words except a boldly printed heading of Shakespeare\\'s poem, A Lover\\'s Complaint, as if in that mournful moment Keats desired to appropriate to his last poetic utterance a style and title already immortal.  Lord Houghton gives a variant of the last line -- \\'Half-passionless, and so swoon on to death.\\'As there is no trace of this in the Shakespeare, there must have been another manuscript -- perhaps a pencilled draft -- and it is to be presumed that the words \\'fall and swell\\', in line 11 of Lord Houghton\\'s text occurred in that, \\'swell and fall\\', the reading of the Shakespeare, being in that case an error of transcription on Keats\\'s part. The date of the poem is about the end of September or beginning of October 1820.

wounded him deeply and it appeared to me from that hour he began to droop he wrote his exquisite ode to the nightingale at this time and as we were one evening walking in the kilburn meadows he repeated it to me before he put it to paper in low tremulous undertone which affected me extremely lord houghton says the ode was suggested by the continued song of nightingale which in the spring of 1819 had built its nest close to wentworth place keats says his lordship aldine ed 1876 pg 237 took great pleasure in her song and one morning took his chair from the breakfast table to the grass plot under plum tree where he remained between two and three hours he then reached the house with some scraps of paper in his hand which he soon put together in the form of his ode stanza of keats

sister who walks about my imagination like ghost she is so like tom in the same letter he says it runs in my head we shall all die young stanza in the last line of this stanza the word fairy instead of faery stands in the manuscript and in the annals but the lamia volume reads faery which enhances the poetic value of the line in the subtlest manner eliminating all possible connexion of fairy land

excuses himself on the plea of fatigue my chief purpose in including these verses here is that students may note the variety of the pieces of this class addressed to different correspondents compare this with the devon pieces sent to haydon and more particularly with the gadfly sent to tom keats little later than this presume this piece should be dated the 3rd of july 1818 stanza this is genuine autobiographic reminiscence of the time when the young keatses lived with their grandmother after the death of their parents stanza there is an under current of dissatisfaction with things caledonian

sort of recitative that so well suited his deep grave voice as they strolled together through kilburn meadows leaving an indelible impression on the mind of his surviving friend there is some reason for thinking that the particular urn which inspired this beautiful poem is somewhat weather beaten work in marble still preserved in the garden of holland house and figured in piranesi vasi candelabri

rather to the morning of the 3rd than to the evening of the 2nd and that keats took out his current letter to his sister at auchencairn on pausing there to breakfast and wrote the poem into it when he

and the fauns from rushes green and brakes and cowslip lawns the ever smitten hermes empty left his golden throne bent warm on amorous theft from high olympus had he stolen light on this side of jove clouds to escape the sight of his great summoner and made retreat into forest on the shores of crete for somewhere in that sacred island dwelt nymph to whom all hoofed satyrs knelt at whose white feet the languid tritons poured pearls while on land they wither’d and adored fast by the springs where she to bathe was will not and in those meads where sometime she might haunt were strewn rich gifts unknown to any muse though fancy’s casket were unlock’d to choose ah what world of love was at her feet so hermes thought and celestial heat burnt from his winged heels to either ear that from whiteness as the lily clear blush’d into roses ’mid his golden hair fallen in jealous curls about his shoulders bare from vale to vale from wood to wood he flew breathing upon the flowers his passion new and wound with many river to its head to find where this sweet nymph prepar’d her secret bed in vain the sweet nymph might nowhere be found and so he rested on the lonely ground pensive and full of painful jealousies of the wood gods and even the very trees there as he stood he heard mournful voice such as once heard in gentle heart destroys all pain but pity thus the lone voice spake “when from this wreathed tomb shall awake “when move in sweet body fit for life “and love and pleasure and the ruddy strife “of hearts and lips ah miserable me the god dove footed glided silently round bush and tree soft brushing in his speed the taller grasses and full flowering weed until he found palpitating snake bright and cirque couchant in dusky brake she was gordian shape of dazzling hue vermilion spotted golden green and blue striped like zebra freckled like pard eyed like peacock and all crimson barr’d and full of silver moons that as she breathed dissolv’d or brighter shone or interwreathed their lustres with the gloomier tapestries— so rainbow sided touch’d with miseries she seem’d at once some penanced lady elf some demon’s mistress or the demon’s self upon her crest she wore wannish fire sprinkled with stars like ariadne’s tiar her head was serpent but ah bitter sweet she had woman’s mouth with all its pearls complete and for her eyes what could such eyes do there but weep and weep that they were born so fair as proserpine still weeps for her sicilian air her throat was serpent but the words she spake came as through bubbling honey for love’s sake and thus while hermes on his pinions lay like stoop’d falcon ere he takes his prey “fair hermes crown’d with feathers fluttering light “i had splendid dream of thee last night “i saw thee sitting on throne of gold “among the gods upon olympus old “the only sad one for thou didst not hear “the soft lute finger’d muses chaunting clear “nor even apollo when he sang alone “deaf to his throbbing throat’s long long melodious moan “i dreamt saw thee robed in purple flakes “break amorous through the clouds as morning breaks “and swiftly as bright phoebean dart “strike for the cretan isle and here thou art “too gentle hermes hast thou found the maid whereat the star of lethe not delay’d his rosy eloquence and thus inquired “thou smooth lipp’d serpent surely high inspired “thou beauteous wreath with melancholy eyes “possess whatever bliss thou canst devise “telling me only where my nymph is fled “where she doth breathe “bright planet thou hast said return’d the snake “but seal with oaths fair god “i swear said hermes “by my serpent rod “and by thine eyes and by thy starry crown light flew his earnest words among the blossoms blown then thus again the brilliance feminine “too frail of heart for this lost nymph of thine “free as the air invisibly she strays “about these thornless wilds her pleasant days “she tastes unseen unseen her nimble feet “leave traces in the grass and flowers sweet “from weary tendrils and bow’d branches green “she plucks the fruit unseen she bathes unseen “and by my power is her beauty veil’d “to keep it unaffronted unassail’d “by the love glances of unlovely eyes “of satyrs fauns and blear’d silenus’ sighs “pale grew her immortality for woe “of all these lovers and she grieved so “i took compassion on her bade her steep “her hair in weird syrops that would keep “her loveliness invisible yet free “to wander as she loves in liberty “thou shalt behold her hermes thou alone “if thou wilt as thou swearest grant my boon then once again the charmed god began an oath and through the serpent’s ears it ran warm tremulous devout psalterian ravish’d she lifted her circean head blush’d live damask and swift lisping said “i was woman let me have once more “a woman’s shape and charming as before “i love youth of corinth—o the bliss “give me my woman’s form and place me where he is “stoop hermes let me breathe upon thy brow “and thou shalt see thy sweet nymph even now the god on half shut feathers sank serene she breath’d upon his eyes and swift was seen of both the guarded nymph near smiling on the green it was no dream or say dream it was real are the dreams of gods and smoothly pass their pleasures in long immortal dream one warm flush’d moment hovering it might seem dash’d by the wood nymph’s beauty so he burn’d then lighting on the printless verdure turn’d to the swoon’d serpent and with languid arm delicate put to proof the lythe caducean charm so done upon the nymph his eyes he bent full of adoring tears and blandishment and towards her stept she like moon in wane faded before him cower’d nor could restrain her fearful sobs self folding like flower that faints into itself at evening hour but the god fostering her chilled hand she felt the warmth her eyelids open’d bland and like new flowers at morning song of bees bloom’d and gave up her honey to the lees into the green recessed woods they flew nor grew they pale as mortal lovers do left to herself the serpent now began to change her elfin blood in madness ran her mouth foam’d and the grass therewith besprent wither’d at dew so sweet and virulent her eyes in torture fix’d and anguish drear hot glaz’d and wide with lid lashes all sear flash’d phosphor and sharp sparks without one cooling tear the colours all inflam’d throughout her train she writh’d about convuls’d with scarlet pain deep volcanian yellow took the place of all her milder mooned body’s grace and as the lava ravishes the mead spoilt all her silver mail and golden brede made gloom of all her frecklings streaks and bars eclips’d her crescents and lick’d up her stars so that in moments few she was undrest of all her sapphires greens and amethyst and rubious argent of all these bereft nothing but pain and ugliness were left still shone her crown that vanish’d also she melted and disappear’d as suddenly and in the air her new voice luting soft cried “lycius gentle lycius ”—borne aloft with the bright mists about the mountains hoar these words dissolv’d crete’s forests heard no more whither fled lamia now lady bright full born beauty new and exquisite she fled into that valley they pass over who go to corinth from cenchreas’ shore and rested at the foot of those wild hills the rugged founts of the peraean rills and of that other ridge whose barren back stretches with all its mist and cloudy rack south westward to cleone there she stood about young bird’s flutter from wood fair on sloping green of mossy tread by clear pool wherein she passioned to see herself escap’d from so sore ills while her robes flaunted with the daffodils ah happy lycius —for she was maid more beautiful than ever twisted braid or sigh’d or blush’d or on spring flowered lea spread green kirtle to the minstrelsy virgin purest lipp’d yet in the lore of love deep learned to the red heart’s core not one hour old yet of sciential brain to unperplex bliss from its neighbour pain define their pettish limits and estrange their points of contact and swift counterchange intrigue with the specious chaos and dispart its most ambiguous atoms with sure art as though in cupid’s college she had spent sweet days lovely graduate still unshent and kept his rosy terms in idle languishment why this fair creature chose so fairily by the wayside to linger we shall see but first it is fit to tell how she could muse and dream when in the serpent prison house of all she list strange or magnificent how ever where she will’d her spirit went whether to faint elysium or where down through tress lifting waves the nereids fair wind into thetis’ bower by many pearly stair or where god bacchus drains his cups divine stretch’d out at ease beneath glutinous pine or where in pluto’s gardens palatine mulciber’s columns gleam in far piazzian line and sometimes into cities she would send her dream with feast and rioting to blend and once while among mortals dreaming thus she saw the young corinthian lycius charioting foremost in the envious race like young jove with calm uneager face and fell into swooning love of him now on the moth time of that evening dim he would return that way as well she knew to corinth from the shore for freshly blew the eastern soft wind and his galley now grated the quaystones with her brazen prow in port cenchreas from egina isle fresh anchor’d whither he had been awhile to sacrifice to jove whose temple there waits with high marble doors for blood and incense rare jove heard his vows and better’d his desire for by some freakful chance he made retire from his companions and set forth to walk perhaps grown wearied of their corinth talk over the solitary hills he fared thoughtless at first but ere eve’s star appeared his phantasy was lost where reason fades in the calm’d twilight of platonic shades lamia beheld him coming near more near— close to her passing in indifference drear his silent sandals swept the mossy green so neighbour’d to him and yet so unseen she stood he pass’d shut up in mysteries his mind wrapp’d like his mantle while her eyes follow’d his steps and her neck regal white turn’d—syllabling thus “ah lycius bright “and will you leave me on the hills alone “lycius look back and be some pity shown he did not with cold wonder fearingly but orpheus like at an eurydice for so delicious were the words she sung it seem’d he had lov’d them whole summer long and soon his eyes had drunk her beauty up leaving no drop in the bewildering cup and still the cup was full —while he afraid lest she should vanish ere his lip had paid due adoration thus began to adore her soft look growing coy she saw his chain so sure “leave thee alone look back ah goddess see “whether my eyes can ever turn from thee “for pity do not this sad heart belie— “even as thou vanishest so shall die “stay though naiad of the rivers stay “to thy far wishes will thy streams obey “stay though the greenest woods be thy domain “alone they can drink up the morning rain “though descended pleiad will not one “of thine harmonious sisters keep in tune “thy spheres and as thy silver proxy shine “so sweetly to these ravish’d ears of mine “came thy sweet greeting that if thou shouldst fade “thy memory will waste me to shade “for pity do not melt ”—“if should stay said lamia “here upon this floor of clay “and pain my steps upon these flowers too rough “what canst thou say or do of charm enough “to dull the nice remembrance of my home “thou canst not ask me with thee here to roam “over these hills and vales where no joy is “empty of immortality and bliss “thou art scholar lycius and must know “that finer spirits cannot breathe below “in human climes and live alas poor youth “what taste of purer air hast thou to soothe “my essence what serener palaces “where may all my many senses please “and by mysterious sleights hundred thirsts appease “it cannot be—adieu so said she rose tiptoe with white arms spread he sick to lose the amorous promise of her lone complain swoon’d murmuring of love and pale with pain the cruel lady without any show of sorrow for her tender favourite’s woe but rather if her eyes could brighter be with brighter eyes and slow amenity put her new lips to his and gave afresh the life she had so tangled in her mesh and as he from one trance was wakening into another she began to sing happy in beauty life and love and every thing song of love too sweet for earthly lyres while like held breath the stars drew in their panting fires and then she whisper’d in such trembling tone as those who safe together met alone for the first time through many anguish’d days use other speech than looks bidding him raise his drooping head and clear his soul of doubt for that she was woman and without any more subtle fluid in her veins than throbbing blood and that the self same pains inhabited her frail strung heart as his and next she wonder’d how his eyes could miss her face so long in corinth where she said she dwelt but half retir’d and there had led days happy as the gold coin could invent without the aid of love yet in content till she saw him as once she pass’d him by where ’gainst column he leant thoughtfully at venus’ temple porch ’mid baskets heap’d of amorous herbs and flowers newly reap’d late on that eve as it was the night before the adonian feast whereof she saw no more but wept alone those days for why should she adore lycius from death awoke into amaze to see her still and singing so sweet lays then from amaze into delight he fell to hear her whisper woman’s lore so well and every word she spake entic’d him on to unperplex’d delight and pleasure known let the mad poets say whate’er they please of the sweets of fairies peris goddesses there is not such treat among them all haunters of cavern lake and waterfall as real woman lineal indeed from pyrrha’s pebbles or old adam’s seed thus gentle lamia judg’d and judg’d aright that lycius could not love in half fright so threw the goddess off and won his heart more pleasantly by playing woman’s part with no more awe than what her beauty gave that while it smote still guaranteed to save lycius to all made eloquent reply marrying to every word twinborn sigh and last pointing to corinth ask’d her sweet if it was too far that night for her soft feet the way was short for lamia’s eagerness made by spell the triple league decrease to few paces not at all surmised by blinded lycius so in her comprized they pass’d the city gates he knew not how so noiseless and he never thought to know as men talk in dream so corinth all throughout her palaces imperial and all her populous streets and temples lewd mutter’d like tempest in the distance brew’d to the wide spreaded night above her towers men women rich and poor in the cool hours shuffled their sandals over the pavement white companion’d or alone while many light flared here and there from wealthy festivals and threw their moving shadows on the walls or found them cluster’d in the corniced shade of some arch’d temple door or dusky colonnade muffling his face of greeting friends in fear her fingers he press’d hard as one came near with curl’d gray beard sharp eyes and smooth bald crown slow stepp’d and robed in philosophic gown lycius shrank closer as they met and past into his mantle adding wings to haste while hurried lamia trembled “ah said he “why do you shudder love so ruefully “why does your tender palm dissolve in dew ”— “i am wearied said fair lamia “tell me who “is that old man cannot bring to mind “his features —lycius wherefore did you blind “yourself from

palms cover continents am afoot with my vision by the city quadrangular houses in log huts camping with lumbermen along the ruts of the turnpike along the dry gulch and rivulet bed weeding my onion patch or hoeing rows of carrots and parsnips crossing savannas trailing in forests prospecting gold digging girdling the trees of new purchase scorch ankle deep by the hot sand hauling my boat down the shallow river where the panther walks to and fro on limb overhead where the buck turns furiously at the hunter where the rattlesnake suns his flabby length on rock where the otter is feeding on fish where the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the bayou where the black bear is searching for roots or honey where the beaver pats the mud with his paddle shaped tail over the growing sugar over the yellow flower cotton plant over the rice in its low moist field over the sharp peak farm house with its scallop scum and slender shoots from the gutters over the western persimmon over the long leav corn over the delicate blue flower flax over the white and brown buckwheat hummer and buzzer there with the rest over the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and shades in the breeze scaling mountains pulling myself cautiously up holding on by low scragged limbs walking the path worn in the grass and beat through the leaves of the brush where the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the wheat lot where the bat flies in the seventh month eve where the great gold bug drops through the dark where the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree and flows to the meadow where cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous shuddering of their hides where the cheese cloth hangs in the kitchen where andirons straddle the hearth slab where cobwebs fall in festoons from the rafters where trip hammers crash where the press is whirling its cylinders wherever the human heart beats with terrible throes under its ribs where the pear shaped balloon is floating aloft floating in it myself and looking composedly down where the life car is drawn on the slip noose where the heat hatches pale green eggs in the dented sand where the she whale swims with her calf and never forsakes it where the steam ship trails hind ways its long pennant of smoke where the fin of the shark cuts like black chip out of the water where the half burn brig is riding on unknown currents where shells grow to her slimy deck where the dead are corrupting below where the dense starr flag is borne at the head of the regiments approaching manhattan up by the long stretching island

he festivals with blackguard gibes ironical license bull dances drinking laughter at the cider mill tasting the sweets of the brown mash sucking the juice through straw at apple peelings wanting kisses for all the red fruit find at musters beach parties friendly bees huskings house raisings where the mocking bird sounds his delicious gurgles cackles screams weeps where the hay rick stands in

where the heifers browse where geese nip their food with short jerks where sun down shadows lengthen over the limitless and lonesome prairie where herds of buffalo make crawling spread of the square miles far and near where the humming bird shimmers where the neck of the long lived swan is curving and winding where the laughing gull scoots by the shore where she laughs her near human laugh where bee hives range on gray bench in the garden half hid by the high weeds where band neck partridges roost in ring on the ground with their heads out where burial coaches enter the arch gates of cemetery where winter wolves bark amid wastes of snow and icicled trees where the yellow crown heron comes to the edge of the marsh at night and feeds upon small crabs where the splash of swimmers and divers

bush boy behind me he rides at the drape of the day far from the settlements studying the print of animals feet or the moccasin print by the cot in the hospital reaching lemonade to feverish patient nigh the coffin corpse when all is still examining with candle voyaging to every port to dicker and adventure hurrying with the modern crowd as eager and fickle as any hot toward one hate ready in my madness to knife him solitary at midnight in my back yard my thoughts gone from me long while walking the old hills of judæa with the beautiful gentle god by my side speeding through space speeding through heaven and the stars speeding amid the seven satellites and the broad ring and the diameter of eighty thousand miles speeding with tail meteors throwing fire balls like the rest carrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in its belly storming enjoying planning loving cautioning backing and filling appearing and disappearing tread day and night such roads visit the orchards of spheres and look at the product and look at quintillions ripen and look at quintillions green fly those flights of fluid and swallowing soul my course runs below the soundings of plummets

plenty light enough through the clear atmosphere stretch around on the wonderful beauty the enormous masses of ice pass me and pass them the scenery is plain in all directions the white topt mountains show in the distance fling out my fancies toward them we are approaching some great battle field in which we are soon to be engaged we pass the colossal outposts of the encampment we pass with still

follow with them and tack with them three days and would not give it up how he saved the drifting company at last how the lank loose gown women look when boated from the side of their prepared graves

not curious about god no array of terms can say how much am at peace about god and about death hear and behold god in every object yet understand god not in the least nor do understand who there can be more wonderful than myself why should wish to see god better than this day see something of god each hour of the twenty four and each moment then in the faces of men and women see god and in my own
